This Act may be cited as the AUKUS Submarine Transfer Authorization Act.2. Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) The trilateral security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (in this Act referred to as the AUKUS partnership) provides an opportunity to deepen maritime cooperation and coordination among the AUKUS partnership.

(4) The Australian Government Defence Strategic Review, released on April 24, 2023, recognizes the need for a biennial National Defense Strategy. This Review prioritizes the acquisition and need for Australian infrastructure for the sustainment of nuclear-powered submarines through the AUKUS partnership.
