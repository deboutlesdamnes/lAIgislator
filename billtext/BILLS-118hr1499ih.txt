
1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Good Jobs for Good Airports Act. 2. Findings; purposes
 (a) Findings
Congress finds the following:

(1) Safe and effective airport operations are essential to national commerce and the general welfare. 
(2) A well-trained, stable workforce at our Nation’s airports is critical to ensuring public safety and security, as well as the health and safety of the public and protection from infectious diseases.

(3) The Federal Government has invested billions of dollars in creating and maintaining our Nation’s aviation infrastructure, reflecting the national interest in maintaining airports across the country. 
(4) Airport services are most effective when the workforce providing those services is able to earn a living wage and able to secure adequate health benefit coverage. In fact, meeting the growing challenges of operating airports securely and efficiently requires the recruitment and retention of excellent staff in all of the classifications of employees who work in airport services and operations.

(5) Effective management of airports and effective airport security requires that workforce turnover be reduced and that the workforce be highly trained and highly motivated. 
(6) In connection with setting workplace standards for those engaged in airport services, there is a need to establish an orderly system that reconciles competing interests without undue disruption.
(b) Purposes
The purposes of this Act are— 
(1) to provide a mechanism for ensuring minimum workplace standards for individuals who work in airports whose operators are grantees of Federal assistance or derive revenue from fees authorized by the Federal Government; and

(2) to serve the best interests of the people of the United States by stabilizing the workplace conditions of the labor pool that supports our Nation's airport operations. 3. Amendments to title 49 of the United States Code to ensure minimum wage and benefits for covered service workers
