Congress finds the following: 
(1) A recent opinion poll of Americans showed support for traditional values has significantly declined.

(2) A majority of Americans no longer view values like faith, family, patriotism, or being involved in the community as very important. 
(3) These values used to unite Americans.

(4) The decline in these values has corresponded with a rise in crime, drug abuse, alienation, and family disintegration. 
(5) Fidelity means dedication to faith, spouses and families, and our country and communities.

(6) Citizens of all faiths can join in recommitting our Nation to fidelity. 
(7) Our Founding Father John Adams said, Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other..

(8) Our survival as a country depends on the shared bonds of faith, family, and patriotism. 
(9) It is fitting to observe a month of rededicating our Nation to our core values.
2. Designation of Fidelity Month by the President
The President shall designate one month each year as Fidelity Month for the purpose of rededicating our Nation to the values of faith, family, and patriotism.
