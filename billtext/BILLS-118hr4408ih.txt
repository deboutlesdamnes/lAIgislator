(c) Standard of review for provisional approval
 
(1) Requirements
An application for provisional approval under this section may be approved only if the Secretary determines that—
(A) there is substantial evidence of safety for the drug, such that there is evidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of the drug involved, on the basis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling; and (B) there is relevant early evidence based on adequate and well-controlled investigations, including early-stage clinical investigations, to establish that—
(i) the drug provides a positive therapeutic outcome; and  (ii) the outcome of the drug is consistent with or greater than currently marketed on-label therapies, with equal or fewer side effects, if there are currently marketed on-label therapies. 

(2) Protocols
The Secretary shall promulgate rules that establish the appropriate protocols to enable rolling, real-time, mid-trial submission while preserving the integrity of the ongoing trial and without penalizing the sponsor for seeking provisional approval under this section.  
(3) Real world evidence
