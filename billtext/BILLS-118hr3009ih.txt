1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Military Suicide Prevention in the 21st Century Act.2. Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) Although electronic devices, such as mobile phones, computers, and tables, increasingly are being leveraged as vehicles for health in the civilian world, almost nothing is known about how covered devices may be used among members of the Armed Forces to positively impact the health of such members.
(2) The Defense Health Agency created the Virtual Hope Box application to help members of the Armed Forces build resilience.
(3) Users of the Virtual Hope Box application reported significantly greater ability to cope with unpleasant emotions and thoughts.
(4) Members of the Armed Forces who are behavioral health patients experiencing distress, emotional dysregulation, or suicidal ideation are often separated from direct clinical support when they need it.
(5) The Virtual Hope Box application offers a highly portable, accessible, and discreet tool for effectively increasing coping self-efficacy.
(6) A strongly linked chain of care depends on engaged leaders as well as highly competent first responders, crisis hotline workers, emergency department personnel, chaplains, primary care clinicians, and behavioral health clinicians.3.
