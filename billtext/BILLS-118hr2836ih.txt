1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Cash to Classrooms Act. 2. Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) Only 7 State governments use a funding formula for public schools reliant on calculating the average number of students in seats in district schools calculated over a State-determined period of time.
(2) Multiple studies show that average daily attendance formulas are more susceptible to absenteeism issues and can result in significantly decreased funding for certain schools.
(3) Many schools who suffer from chronic absenteeism serve socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, such as low income and minority students.
(4) Under average daily attendance formulas, schools who serve disadvantaged groups who are more likely to suffer higher rates of absenteeism lose more funding than other schools, which creates a lack of resources to address absenteeism.3. Prohibiting the use of average daily attendance for public school funding formulas
No State shall utilize a funding formula for public schools that is based on calculating the average daily attendance of students over a State-determined period of time.
