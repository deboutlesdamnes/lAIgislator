International online communication research activities pilot program.Sec. 11. Definitions.2. Sense of Congress
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) substantial and deliberate investments across languages are essential to protect the safety of users online and ensure equitable access to digital spaces;
(2) online platforms have historically under-invested in ensuring non-English content moderation and automated content detection and filtering processes keep pace with their English counterparts, providing little transparency into the efficacy of efforts to detect, review, and remove content that violates laws or platform policies across languages; 
(3) this difference in enforcement for platforms' existing policies and uneven moderation practices across both manual and automated processes has increased the proliferation of illegal and harmful content across many languages and the deliberate targeting of non-English-speaking communities for fraud and harassment; and
(4) any reform effort for online platform safety must ensure equitable investment across languages in order to promote economic opportunity, public health, and civil rights.3. Duty to ensure consistent enforcement
(a) In general
The operator of a covered platform shall provide that processes used by the platform for detecting, suppressing, and removing illegal content, or content that otherwise violates platform policies, are reasonably consistent for languages in which the covered platform engages in monetization practices.(b) Considerations
Any entity enforcing or promulgating rules under subsection (a) shall take into consideration factors that may impact the covered platform's ability to enforce its policies with respect to content in a given language, including staffing levels and language proficiency, or the effectiveness of automated systems designed to filter or flag content for additional review.(c) Rule of construction; limitation on regulation
Nothing in this section shall be construed to require, and no regulation issued by the Commission to carry out this section may require, that a covered platform take any particular action on a specific piece of content or class of content.4. Disclosures on staffing and automated processes
(a) In general
The operator of a covered platform shall, not less than annually, submit to the Commission and make available to the public, in a machine-readable format, a clear and easily comprehensible report on any manual and algorithmic content moderation that the covered platform engaged in during the relevant period. Each such report shall be in compliance with the rules established under subsection (b).(b) Rules
The Commission shall, in accordance with section 8, establish rules for reports under subsection (a). Such rules shall require that a report include the following information:
(1) Content moderation staffing
(A) In general
The number of staff employed by the covered platform (whether directly employed by the platform or contracted through a third party) for the purposes of manually reviewing content for removal or other interventions, in aggregate and broken down by—(i) the countries in which the employees are located;(ii) the geographic or regional area to which the employees are assigned; and(iii) languages spoken by the employees relevant to their employment and their levels of language proficiency.(B) Staff support
A description of the training and support provided to content moderation staff, including—(i) the training processes and guidelines provided;(ii) the support services, such as mental health services, available to the employee; and(iii) if training or support services differ by factors such as geographic region, languages spoken, or direct-hire versus contracted employees, descriptions and breakdowns of such differences.
(2) Automated content detection processes
If the covered platform elects to use algorithmic processes to detect content for additional manual review or automated moderation, information on such processes, including—(A) performance metrics that are monitored to ensure consistent behavior for such processes across languages and the languages that are monitored; and(B) other safeguards in place to ensure consistent behavior of such systems across languages.
(3) Monetization across languages
The list of languages in which the covered platform engages in monetization practices and the percentage breakdown by language of the covered platform's revenue throughout the duration of the relevant reporting period.
(4) In-language review
Of all content that is manually reviewed by staff, provide information on content that is reviewed in the original language used to create the content rather than being subject to automated translation before review, including—(A) the percentage of content reviewed in the original language for each language in which the covered platform engages in monetization practices; and(B) a description of the policies governing whether and to what extent content will be manually reviewed in the original language or automatically translated prior to manual review.
(5) Translation and review processes
With respect to the content review practices of the covered platform—(A) the list of languages in which content is reviewed without translation; and (B) for languages in which automated translation is applied prior to manual review, a description of—(i) the process by which content is translated; and(ii) the process by which that content is reviewed and how, if at all, that process differs from the process used to review content in the original language.
(6) Content moderation outcome measures
(A) Number of content takedowns
The number of content takedowns over the relevant reporting period for each language in which the covered platform engages in monetization practices.(B) Response time
The average response time to user-initiated takedown or content review requests over the relevant reporting period for each language in which the covered platform engages in monetization practices.
(7) Additional information
Other information determined appropriate by the Commission, including additional categories or criteria relevant to the information described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (4).5. Consistent access to tools and documentation
The operator of a covered platform shall—
(1) provide that all user tools for reporting content for review or automated action are accessible across all languages in which the covered platform offers its service; and
