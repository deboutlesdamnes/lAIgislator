1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Organ Donation Clarification Act of 2023.2. Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) As of May 2023, 113,999 people await an organ transplant, with 95,957 of those people waiting for a kidney, and average wait times are approaching five years for a kidney, with over one-and-a-half times as many people being added to the waiting lists as getting a transplant.
(2) Of the nearly three million Americans who die annually, under 30,000, representing about one percent of all deaths each year, possess major organs healthy enough for transplanting.
(3) On average, 17 people a day died while waiting for an organ in 2020, with the majority of those people waiting for a kidney.
(4) In 2022, approximately 4,498 people were removed from kidney waiting lists and approximately 1,500 from liver (1,123), heart (239), and lungs (145) waiting lists because they became permanently too sick to receive a transplant. 
(5) Over 75 percent of dialysis patients are not employed because dialysis requires multiple treatments per week which last several hours and leave patients drained, thus creating a huge financial burden on the patients, their families, and the government; moreover, lost tax revenue from these individuals is not included in the cost estimates above. 
(6) A patient receiving a kidney transplant, and thus no longer needing dialysis, can enjoy a much higher quality of life for another 10–15 years on average.
(7) As medical advances extend people’s lives on dialysis, the number of patients on dialysis will increase significantly, as will the costs for individuals and the Federal Government.
(8) Roughly seven percent of the Medicare budget goes to the End Stage Renal Disease Program, with dialysis costing Medicare over $90,000 per patient per year, as Federal law dictates that Medicare will cover dialysis for everyone who has made minimal Social Security tax payments.
(9) A kidney transplant pays for itself in less than two years, with each transplant saving an average of $136,000 in medical costs over a 10-year period, 75 percent of which is savings to the taxpayers.
(10) Experts project that if the supply of transplant kidneys could be increased to meet the demand, taxpayers would save more than $16,000,000,000 per year in medical costs.
(11) The World Health Organization estimates that 10 percent of all transplants take place on the international black market, the last choice for desperate patients facing an alternative of death, however recipients often receive infected kidneys and suffer poor health outcomes and donors are often victimized.
(12) Present policy on domestic donation has never been subject to studies or pilots to determine effectiveness in increasing the availability of donated organs and the effectiveness of safeguards that prevent coercion or exploitation, precludes all but altruistic donation, prohibiting any form of incentive or benefit for donors.
(13) In 2010, Israel implemented sweeping changes to its national organ donation program including reducing financial burdens on donors, giving future transplantation priority to registered organ donors and their families, and promoting donation by reimbursing the donor’s medical costs, 40 days of lost wages, and five years of medical and life insurance costs, and as a result saw organ donation approximately triple over a 10-year period.
(14) Experts are arriving at a consensus that trials are necessary to find new methods of promoting additional organ donation which will save lives and reduce organ trafficking.3. Clarification of certain provisions of the National Organ Transplant Act
(a) Valuable consideration
Section 301(c)(2) of the National Organ Transplant Act (42 U.S.C. 274e(c)(2)) is amended to read as follows:

(4) Report to Congress
Not later than three years after the Secretary first approves a covered pilot program, and every three years thereafter until there is no longer a covered pilot program in operation, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Congress on—(A) the impact of covered pilot programs on the organ pool;(B) the demographics of the donors participating in covered pilot programs;(C) the demographics of the recipients of organs donated by participants in covered pilot programs;(D) the effectiveness, fairness, and equitableness of the distribution of nondirected living donor organs that are donated by participants in covered pilot programs; and(E) recommendations to Congress on—(i) improving covered pilot programs; and(ii) expanding the use of noncash benefits to incentivize organ donation..(c) Relationship to payments by recipient of organ
Subsection (d) of section 377 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 274f(d)) is amended to read as follows:(d) Relationship to payments under other programs
