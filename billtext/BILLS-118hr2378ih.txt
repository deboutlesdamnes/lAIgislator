1. Short title
 This Act may be cited as Farmers’ Market and Food Bank Local Revitalization Act of 2023.2. Findings and purpose
(a) Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) Food insecurity, epidemic levels of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and youth osteoporosis are caused by improper nutrition yielded by lack of nutritious, reliable, and locally available healthy food options.
(2) The American Diabetes Association estimated a 41-percent increase in costs of diagnosed diabetes from 2007 ($174,000,000,000) to 2012 ($245,000,000,000) with most of these costs (62 percent) coming from senior health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
(3) Since sequestration in 2008, there has been no funding increase for the Senior Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program.
(4) From 2008 to 2020, the moderate at home food cost for a family of 2 (aged 51–70 years old) increased by an average of $70 a month. The Seniors Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program funding has not kept pace with such inflation.
(5) According to the Department of Agriculture, Seniors Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program has a total program funding backlog of $20,065,021 and a season benefit level backlog of $16,120,741 across all participating States, territories, and Native American Tribes.
(6) Roughly 1 in 10 United States senior citizens (about 5,146,000) are forced to live well below the Federal poverty level, and the Seniors Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program is only able to reach about 725,000 due to inadequate funding.
(7) Since sequestration in 2008, funding for the WIC Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program has fallen by over $6,000,000 and never rebounded.
(8)  The WIC Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program is a vital safeguard for the nearly 1 in 7 children who will be born into poverty in the United States and will be at nutritional risk.
(9) According to the Department of Agriculture, the WIC Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program has a total program and seasonal benefit funding backlog of $6,198,432 across all participating States, territories, and Native American Tribes.
(10) In the United States, food banks will provide meals to 1 in 7 people.
(11) Many food banks share special relationships with local farmers who often donate their crops to food banks. The partnership allows for more efficient and sustainable procurement for food banks.
(12) Assisting food banks to grow their own food will aid local procurement and allow food banks to serve as farming resources to their communities, especially to those who are food insecure.
(13) The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, specifically required looking at ways to incorporate local goods to reduce food waste.(b) Purposes
The purposes of this Act are—
(1) to increase and enhance funding for the Farmers’ Market Nutrition Programs to support seniors and food insecure families, and to increase market capacity for local farmers;
(2) to provide funding assistance for the expansion and construction of farmers’ markets in both rural and urban food desert areas;
(3) to increase local food production through partnership with food banks by local farmer contracting and funding assistance to food banks to grow necessary produce through traditional or controlled environment agricultural farming.3.
