(5) Secretary
The term Secretary means the Secretary of Energy.(b) Domestic mining education strengthening program
The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior (acting through the Director of the United States Geological Survey), shall—
(1) establish a grant program to strengthen domestic mining education; and
(2) under the program established in paragraph (1), award competitive grants to mining schools for the purpose of recruiting and educating the next generation of mining engineers and other qualified professionals to meet the future energy and mineral needs of the United States.(c) Grants

In carrying out the grant program established under subsection (b)(1), the Secretary shall award not more than 10 grants each year to mining schools.
(2) Selection requirements
(A) In general
To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall select recipients for grants under paragraph (1) to ensure geographic diversity among grant recipients to ensure that region-specific specialties are developed for region-specific geology.(B) Timeline
The Secretary shall award the grants under paragraph (1) by not later than the later of—(i) the date that is 180 days after the start of the applicable fiscal year; and(ii) the date that is 180 days after the date on which the Act making full-year appropriations for the Department of Energy for the applicable fiscal year is enacted.

(4) Use of funds
A mining school receiving a grant under paragraph (1) shall use the grant funds—(A) to recruit students to the mining school; and (B) to enhance and support programs related to, as applicable— (i) mining, mineral extraction efficiency, and related processing technology;(ii) emphasizing critical mineral and rare earth element exploration, extraction, and refining;(iii) reclamation technology and practices for active mining operations;(iv) the development of reprocessing systems and technologies that facilitate reclamation that fosters the recovery of resources at abandoned mine sites;(v) mineral extraction methods that reduce environmental and human impacts;(vi) technologies to extract, refine, separate, melt, or produce minerals, including rare earth elements;(vii) reducing dependence on foreign energy and mineral supplies through increased domestic critical mineral production;(viii) enhancing the competitiveness of United States energy and mineral technology exports;(ix) the extraction or processing of coinciding mineralization, including rare earth elements, within coal, coal processing byproduct, overburden, or coal residue;(x) enhancing technologies and practices relating to mitigation of acid mine drainage, reforestation, and revegetation in the reclamation of land and water resources adversely affected by mining;(xi) enhancing exploration and characterization of new or novel deposits, including rare earth elements and critical minerals within phosphate rocks, uranium-bearing deposits, and other nontraditional sources;(xii) meeting challenges of extreme mining conditions, such as deeper deposits or offshore or cold region mining; and(xiii) mineral economics, including analysis of supply chains, future mineral needs, and unconventional mining resources.(d) Mining Professional Development Advisory Board

(1) In general
There is established an advisory board, to be known as the Mining Professional Development Advisory Board.
