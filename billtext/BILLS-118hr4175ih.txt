101. Findings; sense of Congress
(a) Findings
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) On February 24, 2022, the Government of the Russian Federation violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine by engaging in a premeditated, second illegal invasion of Ukraine.
(2) The international community has condemned the illegal invasions of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, as well as the commission of war crimes by the Russian Federation, including through the deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure and the commission of sexual violence.
(3) The leaders of the G7 have called the Russian Federation’s unprovoked and completely unjustified attack on the democratic state of Ukraine a serious violation of international law and a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and all commitments Russia entered in the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris and its commitments in the Budapest Memorandum.
(4) On March 2, 2022, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution ES–11/1, entitled Aggression against Ukraine, by a vote of 141 to 5. That resolution deplore[d] in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine in violation of Article 2(4) of the [United Nations] Charter and demanded that the Russian Federation immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.
(5) On March 16, 2022, the International Court of Justice issued provisional measures ordering the Russian Federation to immediately suspend the military operations that it commenced on 24 February 2022 in the territory of Ukraine.
(6) On November 14, 2022, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution—(A) recognizing that the Russian Federation must bear the legal consequences of all of its internationally wrongful acts, including making reparation for the injury, including any damage, caused by such acts;(B) recognizing the need for the establishment of an international mechanism for reparation for damage, loss, or injury caused by the Russian Federation in Ukraine; and(C) recommending creation of an international register of such damage, loss, or injury. 
(7) Under international law, a country that is responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage it has caused if such damage cannot be made good by restitution. The Russian Federation bears such responsibility to compensate Ukraine, and because of this grave breach of international law, all states are legally entitled to take countermeasures that are proportionate and aimed at inducing the Russian Federation to comply with its international obligations, including countermeasures that suspend ordinary international obligations to the Russian Federation, to help enforce the obligation of the Russian Federation to compensate Ukraine.(b) Sense of congress
It is the sense of Congress that, having committed an act of aggression, as recognized by the United Nations General Assembly on March 2, 2022, the Russian Federation is to be considered as an aggressor state. The extreme illegal actions taken by the Russian Federation, including an act of aggression, present a unique situation, requiring and justifying the establishment of a legal authority to compensate victims of aggression by the Russian Federation in Ukraine. In this case, that authority is the authority of the United States Government and other countries to confiscate Russian sovereign assets in their respective jurisdictions to help enforce the obligation of the Russian Federation to compensate Ukraine. 102. Sense of Congress regarding importance of the Russian Federation providing compensation to Ukraine
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the Russian Federation bears responsibility for the financial burden of the reconstruction of Ukraine and for countless other costs associated with the illegal invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation that began on February 24, 2022;
(2) the full cost of the Russian Federation’s unlawful war against Ukraine and the amount of money the Russian Federation must pay Ukraine should be assessed by an international body or mechanism charged with determining compensation and providing assistance to Ukraine;
(3) the Russian Federation is now on notice of its opportunity to comply with its international obligations, including compensation, or, by agreement with the government of independent Ukraine, authorize an international body or mechanism to address those outstanding obligations with authority to make binding decisions on parties that comply in good faith;
(4) the Russian Federation can, by negotiated agreement, participate in any international process to assess the full cost of the Russian Federation’s unlawful war against Ukraine and make funds available to compensate for damage, loss, and injury arising from its internationally wrongful acts in Ukraine, and if it fails to do so, the United States and other countries should explore other avenues for ensuring compensation to Ukraine, including confiscation and repurposing of assets of the Russian Federation;
(5) the President should lead robust engagement on all bilateral and multilateral aspects of the response by the United States to efforts by the Russian Federation to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including on any policy coordination and alignment regarding the disposition of Russian sovereign assets in the context of compensation;
(6) the confiscation and repurposing of Russian sovereign assets by the United States is in the vital national security interests of the United States and consistent with United States and international law; and
(7) the United States should work with international allies and partners on the confiscation and repurposing of Russian sovereign assets as part of a coordinated, multilateral effort, including with G7 countries and other countries in which Russian sovereign assets are located.103. Prohibition on release of blocked Russian sovereign assets
(a) In general
No Russian sovereign asset that is blocked or immobilized by the Department of the Treasury before the date specified in section 104(g) may be released or mobilized until the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that—

(2) (A) full compensation has been made to Ukraine for harms resulting from the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation; or(B) the Russian Federation is participating in a bona fide international mechanism that, by agreement, will discharge the obligations of the Russian Federation to compensate Ukraine for all amounts determined to be owed to Ukraine.(b) Notification
Not later than 30 days before the release or mobilization of a Russian sovereign asset that previously had been blocked or immobilized by the Department of the Treasury, the President shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees—
(1) a notification of the decision to release or mobilize the asset; and
(2) a justification in writing for such release or mobilization.(c) Joint resolution of disapproval

(1) In general
No Russian sovereign asset that previously had been blocked or immobilized by the Department of the Treasury may be released or mobilized if, within 30 days of receipt of the notification and justification required under subsection (b), a joint resolution is enacted prohibiting the proposed release or mobilization.
(2) Expedited procedures

If such a joint resolution should be vetoed by the President, the time for debate in consideration of the veto message on such measure shall be limited to 20 hours in the Senate and in the House of Representatives shall be determined in accordance with the Rules of the House.(d) Cooperation on prohibition of release of certain Russian sovereign assets
The President may take such action as may be necessary to seek to obtain an agreement or arrangement between the United States, Ukraine, and other countries that have blocked or immobilized Russian sovereign assets to prohibit such assets from being released or mobilized until an agreement has been reached that discharges the Russian Federation from further obligations to compensate Ukraine. 104.
