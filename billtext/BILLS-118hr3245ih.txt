1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Nonprofit Stakeholders Engaging and Advancing Together Act of 2023.2. Findings
The Congress finds that:
(1) The nonprofit sector is a trusted partner in working with American communities, strengthening civil society, and ensuring that all people living in the United States have the opportunity to thrive.
(2) The Nation relies on the nonprofit sector for its ability to harness and direct the generosity, service, and volunteerism of the American people.
(3) Nonprofit organizations are a significant and highly diverse sector of the United States economy that includes 1,800,000 organizations as of 2020, according to the Internal Revenue Service. United States nonprofit organizations contributed $1.5 trillion to the economy in 2022 and accounted for 5.6 percent of the Gross Domestic Product of the United States, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data interpreted by Independent Sector.
(4) Collectively, the nonprofit sector engages through and is supported by more than 12.5 million workers, 20 million board members, 60 million volunteers, and millions more donors. In 2017, United States nonprofit organizations paid over $670 billion in wages.
(5) 92 percent of the 501(c)(3) public charities in the United States have an annual budget of less than $1,000,000 according to data provided by the Internal Revenue Service.
(6) While no Federal agency regularly collects systematic employment data on the nonprofit sector, at the local level, nonprofits are a time-tested mechanism for delivering critical community services.
(7) In order to maximize the nonprofit sector’s ability to utilize Federal investments to respond to community needs, the Federal Government should take steps to encourage, support, and promote volunteerism and charitable giving.
(8) National service programs provide an essential vehicle for Americans of all ages eager to serve their communities and transform their own lives in the process. Service programs also provide a critical pipeline of emerging leaders into the workforce, including the nonprofit workforce.
(9) Like for-profit entities, the nonprofit sector is challenged during times of economic downturns. As employers and providers of services to countless people, the sustainability of this sector is of great national importance, yet the Federal Government provides significant support to for-profit businesses through the Small Business Administration and other agencies and programs that nonprofit organizations are not able to access.
(10) Despite the importance of the nonprofit sector to the United States economy and to the success of many Federal, State, and local policy initiatives, no Federal agency or office has responsibility for evaluating, building, or maintaining the capacity of the nonprofit sector.3. Purposes
The purposes of this Act are the following:
(1) To enhance the ability of the nonprofit sector to address public challenges and maximize opportunities to improve quality of life in the communities where nonprofit organizations work.
(2) To strengthen communities across the United States by making the Federal Government a more productive partner with nonprofit organizations through the establishment of better Federal coordination with respect to, enhanced transparency with respect to, and greater support for the work of nonprofit organizations.
(3) Collect, assemble, and make available Federal data and research on the nonprofit sector and to generate new data and research where necessary to support the development of effective Federal policy.
(4) Raise awareness of the nonprofit sector and the vital civic, social, and economic contributions nonprofit organizations make to the United States.4. White House Office on Nonprofit Sector Partnership
(a) Establishment
There is established in the Executive Office of the President an Office on Nonprofit Sector Partnership (in this section referred to as the Office). The Office will be led by a Nonprofit Advisor.(b) Functions

(6) direct a Federal agency, to be determined by the Nonprofit Advisor within 180 days, to initiate, in consultation with States, a competitive grant process to build a single online portal, such that charities can fulfill State registration and reporting requirements for States that choose to participate through a single filing. An eligible grant recipient must be a nonprofit organization with governing board members possessing experience working to align charitable registration requirements across States. In evaluating applications for this portal, the Federal agency shall consider whether the application will—(A) enable smaller charities to respond to disasters in their communities by raising funds from multiple States;(B) empower the public to make responsible donations, especially to help those in need during natural disasters or other crises of national significance;(C) eliminate costly inefficiencies for charities operating or fundraising in multiple States;(D) help nonprofits meet existing registration and filing requirements;(E) ensure appropriate cybersecurity standards are being met or exceeded;(F) preserve the public’s trust in nonprofits; and(G) establish a sustainable funding mechanism that is not reliant on Federal funding for ongoing costs; and
