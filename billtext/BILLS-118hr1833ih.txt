1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the International Human Rights Defense Act of 2023.2. Findings
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) Around the world, LGBTQI+ people face violence, stigma, and discrimination based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, or sex characteristics.
(2) 67 countries have national laws that criminalize same-sex relations and at least 42 United Nations member states have legal barriers for freedom of expression on issues related to sexual and gender diversity. That is equal to roughly 35 percent of United Nations member states.
(3) 11 countries have jurisdictions in which the death penalty can be imposed for private, consensual same-sex sexual activity.
(4) Despite recent progress made toward decriminalization, marriage equality, and legal gender recognition, several countries have introduced anti-LGBTQI+ pieces of legislation that would further criminalize or stigmatize LGBTQI+ peoples. This includes a draconian law under review in Ghana that would outlaw LGBTQI+ relationships or identities, as well as actions by community allies, and bills that ban so-called LGBTQI+ propaganda, such as those in Russia and Hungary.
(5) In anti-LGBTQI+ prosecutions, law enforcement officials, working in tandem with medical personnel, use the forensically discredited practice of forced anal exams to try to prove same-sex sexual activity or otherwise to torture or intimidate detainees. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture has described forced anal examinations as a form of torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a report in 2015 calling for governments to ban the practice. Human Rights Watch has documented several cases in which forced anal examinations have been used to sentence individuals for same-sex sexual conduct, including in Uzbekistan and Egypt.
(6) The closing of civil society space, particularly with the increased passage or enforcement of laws that prevent the registration or operations of non-governmental organizations, discriminates against LGBTQI+ human rights defenders and is a violation of freedom of association. This includes the wrongful closure of Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), a leading non-governmental organization committed to protecting and advancing the human rights of LGBTQI+ individuals in Uganda.
(7) Extreme violence and insecurity in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Honduras has driven LGBTQI+ people to flee their countries of origin to the United States for protection. At the United States border with Mexico, LGBTQI+ asylum seekers face additional violence and many have been returned to face persecution in their home countries or in third countries that are not safe.
(8) Studies have shown that structural risks including country-level policies, prosecutions, and legal barriers might contribute to higher HIV prevalence among LGBTQI+ people, especially gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. Decriminalization, decreasing enforcement, and stigma reduction are necessary to effective control of HIV.
(9) The Trans Murder Monitoring Project, which monitors homicides of transgender individuals, documented at least 327 trans and gender-diverse people killed between October 1, 2021, and September 30, 2022. Of these cases, 68 percent of all of the murders occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean, with 29 percent of the total occurring in Brazil.
(10) Intersex people experience prejudice and discrimination, including the common performance of medically unnecessary surgeries without their consent or approval, because their bodies do not conform to other people’s expectations about sex and gender.
(11) Violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity are documented in the Department of State’s annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. The report covering 2021 continues to show a clear pattern of human rights violations or abuses in every region of the world based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or sex characteristics. These violations or abuses include murder, rape, torture, death threats, extortion, and imprisonment, as well as loss of employment, housing, access to health care, and other forms of societal stigma and discrimination. The reports further document LGBTQI+-specific restrictions on basic freedoms of assembly, press, and speech in every region of the world.
(12) On December 6, 2011, President Barack Obama released the Presidential Memorandum—International Initiatives to Advance the Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Persons. The memorandum directed all Federal agencies engaged abroad to ensure that United States diplomacy and foreign assistance promote and protect the human rights of LGBTI+ persons.
(13) On February 4, 2021, President Joe Biden issued a similar memorandum, the Memorandum on Advancing the Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Persons Around the World, to promote and protect the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons and establish that it is the policy of the United States to pursue an end to violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or sex characteristics, and to lead by the power of our example in the cause of advancing the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons around the world.
(14) On February 23, 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry appointed senior diplomat Randy Berry as the Department of State’s first-ever Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTI Persons. No person was named to that position during the Trump Administration.
(15) On June 25, 2021, President Joe Biden announced the appointment of Jessica Stern to serve as the United States Special Envoy to Advance the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons. She joined the Department of State on September 27, 2021.
(16) On June 30, 2016, the United Nations Human Rights Council passed a resolution cosponsored by the United States that established an Independent Expert on violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity to help monitor and track discrimination and violence experienced by LGBTQI+ persons around the world.
(17) In May 2020, the United Nations Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity released a report on so-called conversion therapy, which is an umbrella term used to describe interventions based on a belief that a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity can and should be changed. The report concluded that such practices represent significant violations of rights to personal autonomy, health, and free expression and are by their very nature degrading, inhuman and cruel and create a significant risk of torture. The Independent Expert noted the psychological pain and suffering inflicted by practices of conversion therapy are deep and long-lasting and often exacerbate the risk of suicide, and called for a global ban on conversion therapy.
(18) On June 15, 2022, President Joe Biden signed an Executive order in part directing the Secretary of State, in collaboration with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, to develop an action plan to promote an end to so-called conversion therapy around the world and ensure that United States foreign assistance dollars do not fund the practice.3.
