This Act may be cited as the Gas Stove Protection and Freedom Act. 2. Definitions
In this Act:

(1) Commission
The term Commission means the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
(2) Gas stove
The term gas stove means any gas range, gas stove, or household cooking gas appliance that meets the standard set forth in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z21.1/ CSA Z21.1 or any successor standard.

(3) Substantially increase the average price of gas stoves
The term substantially increase the average price of gas stoves means that the average price of a gas stove, annualized over its expected life, would likely be substantially higher than the average spending by United States homeowners on cooking stoves and ovens based on the most recent data for consumer expenditures reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 3. Prohibition on CPSC banning gas stoves
No Federal funds may be used by the Commission to regulate a gas stove as a banned hazardous product under section 8 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2057) or to impose or enforce any consumer product safety standard or rule on gas stoves under section 7 or 9 of such Act (15 U.S.C. 2056 or 2058) that would otherwise result in a prohibition on the use or sale of gas stoves in the United States, would otherwise result in the unavailability in the United States of a type (or class) of product based on the type of fuel the product consumes, or would otherwise substantially increase the average price of gas stoves in the United States.
