
1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Drone Act of 2023. 2. Findings
Congress finds that—

(1) drone technology has the potential to revolutionize commerce, military operations, law enforcement, and various industries, as well as recreation in general; 
(2) drone technology also presents a potential danger to public safety and national security;

(3) drone technology is increasingly being used by drug trafficking and human trafficking organizations at the southern border— (A) to assist in smuggling into the United States high-value items;
(B) for conducting reconnaissance; and (C) even as offensive weapons against competing criminal organizations;

(4) drone technology has been used to deliver into Federal correctional centers contraband such as cell phones, wire cutters, screwdrivers, and hacksaws; 
(5) there were 875 drone sightings in restricted airport airspace in 2020, and 766 such sightings in the first half of 2021, including 36 such sightings in the vicinities of runways; and

(6) while existing Federal law includes some criminal provisions relating to misuse of drones, those provisions are fragmentary in nature and therefore fail to restrain and deter the most serious drone-related crimes. 3. Drone offenses
