
1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Air Carrier Access Amendments Act of 2023. 2. Findings; sense of Congress
 (a) Findings
Congress finds the following:

(1) In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 (Public Law 99–435; 100 Stat. 1080), adding a provision now codified in section 41705 of title 49, United States Code (in this section referred to as the ACAA), prohibiting disability-based discrimination in air transportation. 
(2) Despite the effort, individuals, including veterans, with disabilities continue to experience significant barriers to and with traveling by air, such as—
(A) damaged assistive devices; (B) inaccessible aircraft, lavatories, and communication media;
(C) delayed assistance; (D) inappropriate treatment of service animals;
(E) inadequate disability awareness and sensitivity training; and (F) a lack of suitable seating accommodations.
(b) Sense of Congress
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) access for individuals with disabilities in air transportation must move into the 21st century, or individuals with disabilities will be left behind and unable to compete in today’s job market or enjoy the opportunities available to other citizens of the United States;

(2) aircraft must accommodate individuals with disabilities, and air carriers and foreign air carriers must acquire and maintain aircraft that meet broad accessibility standards; 
(3) the ACAA must be updated to improve access to air transportation for individuals with disabilities;

(4) legislation is necessary to modernize standards and requirements that will strengthen accessibility in air transportation; 
(5) the Department of Transportation, in direct consultation with the Access Board, must promulgate regulations to ensure that all passengers with disabilities receive—
(A) prompt and effective boarding, deplaning, and connections between flights; (B) accommodations, including nonstandard accommodations, that safely facilitate air travel; and
(C) better access to airport facilities, including the provision of visually and tactilely accessible announcements and full and equal access to aural communications; 
(6) legislation is necessary to ensure that individuals with disabilities have adequate remedies available when air carriers and foreign air carriers violate the ACAA; and

(7) unlike other civil rights statutes, the ACAA does not contain a private right of action, which is critical to the enforcement of such statutes, and Congress must correct this anomaly. 3. Definitions

(1) Access Board
The term Access Board means the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board.
