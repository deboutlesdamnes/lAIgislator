(a) In general
The Attorney General shall, subject to the availability of appropriations, establish a national communications network, to be known as the Green Alert communications network, within the Department of Justice to provide assistance to regional and local search efforts for missing veterans through the initiation, facilitation, and promotion of local elements of the network (referred to in this Act as Green Alert plans), in coordination with States, federally or State recognized Tribes, units of local government, law enforcement agencies, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other concerned entities with expertise in providing services to veterans.(b) Coordination with AMBER alert network and other alert networks
In establishing the Green Alert communications network under subsection (a), the Attorney General shall work with States to ensure, when feasible, the Green Alert communications network is able to operate in coordination with a State’s existing AMBER Alert communications network, established under subtitle A of title III of the PROTECT Act (34 U.S.C. 20501 et seq.), and any other State alert networks, to maximize the efficiency of all such alert systems, and to prevent overuse or improper activations of such networks.4.
