1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Bring Our Heroes Home Act.2. Findings, declarations, and purposes
(a) Findings and declarations
Congress finds and declares the following:
(1) A vast number of records relating to Missing Armed Forces Personnel have not been identified, located, or transferred to the National Archives following review and declassification. Only in the rarest cases is there any legitimate need for continued protection of records pertaining to Missing Armed Forces Personnel who have been missing for decades.
(2) There has been insufficient priority placed on identifying, locating, reviewing, or declassifying records relating to Missing Armed Forces Personnel and then transferring the records to the National Archives for public access.
(3) Mandates for declassification set forth in multiple Executive orders have been broadly written, loosely interpreted, and often ignored by Federal agencies in possession and control of records related to Missing Armed Forces Personnel.
(4) No individual or entity has been tasked with oversight of the identification, collection, review, and declassification of records related to Missing Armed Forces Personnel.
(5) The interest, desire, workforce, and funding of Federal agencies to assemble, review, and declassify records relating to Missing Armed Forces Personnel have been lacking.
(6) All records of the Federal Government relating to Missing Armed Forces Personnel should be preserved for historical and governmental purposes and for public research.
(7) All records of the Federal Government relating to Missing Armed Forces Personnel should carry a presumption of declassification, and all such records should be disclosed under this Act to enable the fullest possible accounting for Missing Armed Forces Personnel.
(8) Legislation is necessary to create an enforceable, independent, and accountable process for the public disclosure of records relating to Missing Armed Forces Personnel.
(9) Legislation is necessary because section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly known as the Freedom of Information Act), as implemented by Federal agencies, has prevented the timely public disclosure of records relating to Missing Armed Forces Personnel.(b) Purposes
The purposes of this Act are—
(1) to provide for the creation of the Missing Armed Forces Personnel Records Collection at the National Archives; and

(2) the public disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy is so substantial that it outweighs the public interest; or
