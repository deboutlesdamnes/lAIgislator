1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Deter PRC Support to the Russian War Effort Act.2. Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) The People’s Republic of China (in this section referred to as the PRC) and the Russian Federation have, in recent years, forged a closer relationship, based largely on their shared interest in challenging the rules-based international order, in an attempt to reshape that order into one that is more welcoming to their authoritarian systems of government.
(2) The rhetoric of the PRC’s leaders, including Xi Jinping, who called for the unification by force of Taiwan with the People’s Republic of China, mirrors the Russian Federation’s justification for invading Ukraine, poses a danger to international peace and security and the agreed to status quo on Taiwan in the Three Communiques exchanged between Beijing and Washington, and should be condemned by the international community.
(3) On February 24, 2022, Russia launched an unprovoked and unjustified full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and in addition, the United Nation has reported more than 7,800,000 Ukrainian refugees forced to flee across Europe and more than 5,000,000 internally displaced in Ukraine since Russia's invasion began.
(4) The PRC’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson refused to categorize Russia’s attacks as an invasion or war and referred repeatedly to the Russian Federation’s statements on Ukraine, including reiterating criticisms of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and blaming the United States for starting the conflict.
(5) Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Biden Administration has imposed several tranches of sanctions on Putin’s Russia.
(6) On February 22, 2022, President Biden issued Executive Order 14065, which blocks property of certain persons and prohibits certain transactions with respect to continued Russian efforts to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and expands the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660 of March 6, 2014, Executive Order 13661 of March 16, 2014, and Executive Order 13662 of March 20, 2014, and takes additional steps with respect to Executive Order 13685 of December 19, 2014, and Executive Order 13849 of September 20, 2018, finding that the Russian Federation’s purported recognition of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) or Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) regions of Ukraine contradicts Russia’s commitments under the Minsk agreements and further threatens the peace, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and thereby constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
(7) On March 8, 2022, President Biden issued Executive Order 14066, which prohibits certain imports and new investments with respect to continued Russian Federation efforts to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and expands the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024 of April 15, 2021, and takes additional steps with respect to Executive Order 14039 of August 20, 2021, finding that the Russian Federation’s unjustified, unprovoked, unyielding, and unconscionable war against Ukraine, including its recent further invasion in violation of international law, including the United Nations Charter, further threatens the peace, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and thereby constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. 
(8) On March 11, 2022, President Biden issued Executive Order 14068, which further prohibits certain imports and new investments with respect to continued Russian Federation efforts to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and takes additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024 of April 15, 2021, and Executive Order 14039 of August 20, 2021, and expanded by Executive Order 14066 of March 8, 2022. 
(9) On April 6, 2022, President Biden issued Executive Order 14071, prohibiting new investment and certain services to the Russian Federation in response to continued Russian Federation aggression, and takes additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024 of April 15, 2021, expanded by Executive Order 14066 of March 8, 2022, and relied on for additional steps taken in Executive Order 14039 of August 20, 2021, and Executive Order 14068 of March 11, 2022.
(10) In March 2022, as the Biden Administration continued to increase pressure on Putin’s regime through rollouts of the aforementioned sanctions, the head of the PRC’s banking and insurance regulator said the PRC will not participate in the sanctions regime Western nations imposed on Russia and “will continue to maintain normal economic, trade and financial exchanges” with Russia despite its aggression against Ukraine.
(11) Indeed, that same month, according to PRC customs data, Russia bought 9,950 metric tons of alumina from the PRC, which is nearly 10 times more than what it purchased in the same period a year earlier. The PRC’s first-quarter exports of alumina to Russia are nearly six times the volume of all of 2021, suggesting the PRC may find new ways of providing support to Russia.
(12) On June 28, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, added five Chinese companies to the Entity List, in response to their continued support to Russia's military efforts since the imposition of export controls in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
(13) In December 2022, the PRC’s foreign minister stated his country would deepen strategic mutual trust and mutually beneficial cooperation with Russia, and trade between the countries has continued to grow.
(14) As of February 2023, reports based on customs records indicate Chinese state-owned and private companies have exported parts and equipment to sanctioned Russian entities that could be facilitating Putin’s war. This includes shipments of helicopter equipment, jamming technology, drones, and jet-fighter parts to sanctioned Russian government-owned defense firms.
(15) On February 18, 2023, the Secretary of State publicly stated that Chinese companies were already providing non-lethal support to Russia’s war effort and the PRC was considering providing lethal support, including weapons and ammunition. 3. Sense of Congress
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine and the war crimes and human rights violations committed by the Kremlin, Russia’s military, and Russia’s intelligence and security services against the people of Ukraine should be strongly condemned;
(2) any country or entity that provides material support for Russia’s invasion is furthering Russia’s unlawful belligerence and committing of war crimes;
(3) Chinese Government officials and individuals and entities associated with People’s Republic of China that assist the Russian Federation, including Russian Government officials or individuals or entities associated with the Russian Federation, by providing material support or in evading sanctions imposed following the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine are, in so doing, supporting the Russian Federation’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, including alleged war crimes committed by Russian Armed Forces against civilians; 
(4) the President should continue to seek unity with European and other key partners and to uphold sanctions that continue to impose costs on Putin’s regime and deplete the Russian Federation’s war chest;
(5) the President should impose sanctions with respect to those sectors and individuals and entities of the Russian Federation, including Russian Government officials, that are evading sanctions imposed by the United States and allied nations following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; and
(6) the President should encourage other European countries and key partners to enact legislation that is similar to the provisions of this Act.4. Sanctions with respect to the transfer of arms and related materiel by China to Russia
