(1) In general
The Secretary shall provide a one-time waiver of the requirement of subsection (b)(4) for a qualifying airport as applied to projects to carry out repair and replacement of sound insulation for a residential building for which the airport previously received Federal assistance or federally authorized airport assistance under this subchapter if— (A) the Secretary determines that the additional assistance is justified due to—
(i) increased aircraft noise, as determined by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration; or (ii) the residence containing sound insulation treatments or other type of sound proofing material previously installed under this subchapter that is determined to be eligible pursuant to paragraph (2); and 
(B) the building or other structure— (i) falls within the Day Night Level (DNL) 65 standard according to the most recent noise exposure map, as such term is defined in section 150.7 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations; or
(ii) fell within such standard at the time the initial noise mitigation was carried out and an FAA compliant noise auditor has determined that— (I) such sound insulation treatment caused physical damage to the residence; or
(II) the materials used for sound insulation treatment were of low quality and have deteriorated, broken, or otherwise no longer function as intended. 
(2) Eligibility determination
To be eligible for waiver under this subsection for repair or replacement of sound insulation treatment projects, an applicant shall—
(A) ensure that the applicant and the property owner exhaust any amounts available through warranties, insurance coverage, and legal remedies for the sound insulation treatment previously installed on the eligible residence; and (B) demonstrate that an FAA compliant noise auditor conducted an inspection of the residences and determined that—
(i) the sound insulation for which Federal assistance was previously provided has resulted in structural deterioration that was not caused by failure of the property owner to repair or adequately maintain the residential building or through the negligence of the applicant or the property owner; and (ii) the condition of sound insulation treatment described in subparagraph (A) is not attributed to actions taken by an owner or occupant of the residence.

(3) Additional authority for periodic surveys
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall consider a cost allowable under this subchapter for an airport to conduct periodic surveys of properties in which repair and replacement of sound insulation was carried out as described in paragraph (1) and for which the airport previously received Federal assistance or federally authorized airport assistance under this subchapter. Such surveys shall be carried out to identify any properties described in the preceding sentence that are eligible for funds under this subsection..
