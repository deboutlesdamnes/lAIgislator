1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act.2. Findings
The Congress finds the following:
(1) In its 2023 Federal Evidence Agenda on LGBTQI+ Equity, the Subcommittee on Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and Variations in Sex Characteristics (SOGI) Data that operates as part of the Subcommittee on Equitable Data of the National Science and Technology Council found that SOGI data collection can and should become part of standard demographic data collection throughout Federal agencies and that the collection of quality data on LGBTQI+ populations is essential for evidence-based policymaking and programmatic decision making.
(2) The National Academies on Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), in their 2022 report, found that complete and accurate demographic information on the LGBTQI+ community should be standardized and collected.
(3) Comprehensive statistics are needed to inform public policy and Federal programs.
(4) The availability of data also has a critical role in ensuring that any disparities in areas like health outcomes, housing, education, and employment can be addressed.
(5) As of the March release of the NASEM report, limited Federal surveys collect data on sexual orientation and gender, with none currently measuring intersex populations.
(6) The integrity of the Federal statistical system relies on the ability of agencies to determine the content of their statistical surveys based on considerations of relevance, timeliness, accuracy, objectivity, and ability to maintain confidentiality. 3. Requirement to collect data on sexual orientation, gender identity, and variations in sex characteristics

(2) Methods
An identification of appropriate methods to include questions on sexual orientation, gender identity, and variations in sex characteristics in covered surveys that facilitate categorization and voluntary participation and preserve privacy and confidentiality, including protocols for anonymizing data collected and destroying personally identifiable information at the appropriate time and not later than three years after the date on which the information is collected.
(3) Data collection
The use of the appropriate methods identified in paragraph (2) to gather data on sexual orientation, gender identity, and variations in sex characteristics for any survey identified in paragraph (1).

(2) Waiver
The statistical official (as described in section 314 of title 5, United States Code) of each agency, or the head of the agency, for any agency that does not have a statistical official, may waive the requirement under paragraph (1), on a case-by-case basis, if the standards and policies in subsection (c) can not be met, or if adding such information to the survey would impair the ability of the agency to preserve the utility, accuracy, or objectivity of the survey while also generating relevant evidence about the LGBTQI+ community.(c) Confidentiality
Any information collected relating to the sexual orientation, gender identity, or variations in sex characteristics of a covered survey participant shall be maintained in accordance with applicable confidentiality and privacy laws, policies, and standards.(d) Construction

Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall provide a report to Congress on the implementation of the requirements of this Act by agencies, including how the implementation of such requirements by agencies affected the provision of services to persons according to the gender identity, sexual orientation, and variations in sex characteristics of the persons.
