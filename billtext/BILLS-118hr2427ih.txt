
1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Hmong Congressional Gold Medal Act. 2. Findings
The Congress finds the following:

(1) As the Vietnam war spread south and west into Laos, the Central Intelligence Agency recruited and trained Hmong tribesmen to fight back against the communist North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao. 
(2) Over 30,000 Hmong men fought the ground war, flew combat missions, gathered intelligence on North Vietnamese troop movements, interrupted the Ho-Chi-Min Supply Trail, and rescued American pilots downed behind enemy lines.

(3) The Hmong people suffered heavy casualties, and their soldiers died at a rate ten times as high as that of American soldiers in Vietnam. 
(4) Following the Vietnam war, many Hmong were displaced from their villages as they were either bombed or burned down by the North Vietnamese and over 150,000 Hmong fled Laos when the nation fell to communist forces on May 14, 1975.

(5) Due to their ties to the American military, many Hmong who fled Laos came to the United States as refugees to start a new life. 
(6) Currently, there are over 327,000 Hmong living in the United States, with the majority residing in California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.
