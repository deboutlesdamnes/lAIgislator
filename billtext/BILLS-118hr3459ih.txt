(1) In general
Subject to paragraph (2), in promulgating the rule under subsection (a), the Administrator shall implement the final report and recommendations of the Beyond Visual Line of Sight Aviation Rulemaking Committee which were submitted to the Administrator on March 10, 2022.

(1) In general
Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this section, the Administrator shall issue a final rule establishing a regulatory pathway for certification or approval of unmanned aircraft systems to enable commercial BVLOS operations.
(2) Requirements
The final rule described in paragraph (1) shall, at a minimum, do the following:(A) Establish an applicable risk assessment methodology for the authorization of BVLOS unmanned aircraft system operations that includes quantified measures of acceptability which sufficiently account for the total air and ground risks associated with such operations and the means for mitigating such risks, taking into account an aircraft's size, weight, speed, kinetic energy, operational capability, proximity to airports and populated areas, operation over people, and operation beyond the visual line of sight, or operation during the day or night, including consideration of unmanned aircraft using an approved or accepted detect and avoid system appropriate for the class and type of airspace in which the operation is being conducted.(B) Establish remote pilot certification standards for remote pilots for BVLOS operations, taking into account varying levels of automated control and management of unmanned aircraft system flights.(C) Establish an airworthiness process for small unmanned aircraft systems that requires a manufacturer’s declaration of compliance to a Federal Aviation Administration accepted means of compliance, which shall not require type or production certification or the issuance of a special airworthiness certificate.(D) Establish a special airworthiness certificate to be issued upon a manufacturer’s declaration of compliance to a Federal Aviation Administration accepted means of compliance, which—(i) shall not require type or production certification;(ii) shall, at least, govern airworthiness of any unmanned aircraft system that—(I) is not—(aa) a small unmanned aircraft system; and(bb) appropriate for the process described in subparagraph (C), as determined by the Administrator;(II) has a maximum gross weight of not more than 1,320 lbs; and(III) has a maximum speed of 100 miles per hour; and(iii) may require unmanned aircraft systems subject to the certificate to operate in the national airspace system at altitudes below at least—(I) 400 feet above ground level; or(II) with respect to an unmanned aircraft system flown within a 400-foot radius of a structure, 400 feet above the structure's immediate uppermost limit.(E) Amend the Code of Federal Regulations to establish generally applicable standards for the type certification of unmanned aircraft systems that the Administrator determines pose higher air or ground risks such that those unmanned aircraft systems are not appropriate for approvals under the processes described in subparagraph (C) or (D).(F) Establish operating rules for—(i) the operation of the unmanned aircraft systems described in subparagraph (C), (D), or (E); and(ii) certain unmanned aircraft systems to enable lower-risk BVLOS operations without airworthiness requirements in a manner consistent with the final report and recommendations of the Beyond Visual Line of Sight Aviation Rulemaking Committee described in subsection (b)(1).

(2) this lack of progress on a standardized airworthiness and operational approvals approach compels the extension of authority to issue exemptions under section 44807 of such title 49; and
(3) such section 44807—(A) should continue to use a risk-based approach to authorize operations that do not fit within part 107 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations; and(B) should not be limited to type certificate applicants.(b) Extension
Section 44807(d) of title 49, United States Code, is amended by striking September 30, 2023 and inserting on the date the rules described in section 44811 take effect.(c) Clarification
