The Securities and Exchange Commission shall revise section 210.1–02(w)(1)(i)(A) of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, to permit a registrant, in determining the significance of an acquisition or disposition described in such section 210.1–02(w)(1)(i)(A), to calculate the registrant’s aggregate worldwide market value based on the applicable trading value, conversion value, or exchange value of all of the registrant’s outstanding classes of stock (including preferred stock and non-traded common shares that are convertible into or exchangeable for traded common shares) and not just the voting and non-voting common equity of the registrant.
