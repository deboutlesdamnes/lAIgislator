(2) develop methods to accommodate large voluntary standardized and integrated data sets on agricultural, environmental, supply chain, and economic information with variable accuracy and scale;
(3) promote collaboration, open community-based development, and data and information sharing between Federal agencies, National Laboratories, institutions of higher education, nonprofit institutions, industry partners, and other appropriate entities by providing reliable access to secure data and information that are in compliance with Federal rules and regulations;
(4) support research infrastructure and workforce development as the Secretaries determine necessary; and
(5) conduct collaborative research, development, and demonstration of methods and technologies to—(A) improve the efficiency of agriculture operations and processing of agricultural products; and(B) reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with such operations and such processing.(d) Agreements
In carrying out the activities under subsection (a), the Secretaries are authorized to—
(1) carry out reimbursable agreements between the Department of Energy, the Department of Agriculture, and other entities in order to maximize the effectiveness of research and development; and
(2) collaborate with other Federal agencies as appropriate.(e) Report
Not later than two years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretaries shall submit to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate, a report detailing the following:
(1) Interagency coordination between each Federal agency involved in the research and development activities carried out under this section.
(2) Potential opportunities to expand the technical capabilities of the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture.
(3) Collaborative research achievements.
(4) Areas of future mutually beneficial successes.
(5) Continuation of coordination activities between the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture.(f) Research security
The activities authorized under this section shall be applied in a manner consistent with subtitle D of title VI of the Research and Development, Competition, and Innovation Act (enacted as division B of the CHIPS Act of 2022 (Public Law 117–167; 42 U.S.C. 19231 et seq.)).
