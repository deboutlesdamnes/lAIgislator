1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Building Relationships and Increasing Democratic Governance through Engagement to DRC Act of 2023 or the BRIDGE to DRC Act of 2023.2. Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) The United States recognized the Democratic Republic of the Congo (hereafter referred to as the DRC) on June 30, 1960.
(2) The DRC has long suffered from armed conflicts and threats to its territorial integrity, including by the March 23 Movement (M23), the Allied Defense Forces, and the Forces Démocratiques de Liberation du Rwanda (FDLR).
(3) The DRC’s instability is further exacerbated by political instability, endemic corruption, exploitation of its natural resources, armed conflict, gross human rights abuses, and humanitarian crises, which destabilize the region and cause mass human suffering.
(4) The DRC is scheduled to conduct presidential, legislative, provincial, and local elections in December 2023.
(5) The United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) has failed to stabilize eastern DRC and failed its mandate to protect civilians.
(6) The East African Community’s intervention has failed to stem armed conflicts and stabilize eastern DRC.
(7) The DRC has globally significant reserves of rare earth minerals and other critical minerals, including deposits of copper, cobalt, lithium, niobium, germanium, and tantalum.
(8) The DRC is the world’s largest producer and exporter of cobalt and the world’s second largest producer of copper.
(9) The People’s Republic of China (PRC) has a near monopoly of the DRC’s cobalt mining sector, with 15 of the 19 cobalt-producing mines in the DRC being owned or financed by PRC based firms in 2021, which directly contributes to its near monopoly over global critical mineral supply chains.
(10) The PRC refines 80 percent of the world’s cobalt and 60 percent of its lithium.
(11) The United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration projects that the technology costs required for manufacturers to adhere to current industrial targets could increase by $90 billion over the lifetimes of vehicles through 2029, with per-vehicle costs increasing by roughly $1,110 on average per United States consumer for new vehicles.3. Sense of congress
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the stability of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a strategic priority for the United States on the African continent, and it is in the economic and national security interest of the United States to support accountable, inclusive, and democratic governance in the Democratic Republic of Congo;
(2) it is in the United States interest to support additional efforts to end conflict in eastern DRC, including by seeking to stem the Rwandan Government’s support to the M23, the documented use of child soldiers, and the threat posed to the Congolese people from undisciplined elements of the Armed Forces of the DRC and other non-state armed groups;
(3) United States humanitarian assistance remains critical in providing millions of people in the DRC with life-saving aid and alleviating the suffering of people affected by disasters;
(4) as the largest financial contributor to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with an estimated $313,000,000 in fiscal year 2023 appropriations allocated for the mission, the United States should use its voice, vote, and influence in the United Nations Security Council to support the United Nations pre-existing plan to draw down the Mission not later than December 2024;
(5) the current near monopoly of the PRC over the DRC’s cobalt and critical mineral extraction and near monopsony of the PRC over the DRC’s cobalt and global critical mineral processing and refining deprives the DRC of important revenue and added value, and represents an economic and national security threat for the United States that directly impacts United States energy independence and military preparedness;
(6) the United States should ensure development of voluntary standards, support of multi stakeholder alliances and industry coalitions, and pursue actions to end human rights violations, environmental degradation, opaque businesses practices, and widespread forced labor, including child labor, in the DRC’s mining industry, a problem exacerbated by PRC linked companies’ flagrant disregard for human rights;
(7) previous United States policies in regard to the DRC’s natural resources and minerals, such as section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 78m note), have punished the DRC and incentivized illicit trade through the DRC’s neighbors; and
(8) The sale of the Tenke Fungurume mine in 2016, and the undeveloped Kisanfu concession in 2020, to the PRC State-tied mining company CMOC (previously known as China Molybdenum Company Limited) damaged United States economic and national security interests by contributing to the PRC’s control of global cobalt supply chains.4. Statement of policy
It is the policy of the United States to—
(1) support the conduct of free, fair, and on time democratic elections in the DRC by advocating for enhanced civic education, an inclusive and transparent voter registration process that includes voter access in all provinces, including those where a state of siege declaration applies, and enabling all candidates to fairly compete, including through respecting all candidates’ rights to free expression and free assembly;
(2) encourage the adoption of measures that ensure the elections in the DRC are free, fair and democratic, including through support for transparent tabulation processes, the publication of both preliminary and final electoral results by the Commission Électorale Nationale Indépendante (CENI) on its website and polling station premises in an appropriate timeframe to allow cross-checking against data gathered by election observers, and broad access for credible election observation by domestic and international actors including, where appropriate, civil society and faith-based entities, such as the Conférence Episcopale Nationale du Congo and the Church of Christ in Congo;
(3) contribute to efforts to end the M23 conflict, including by supporting the African Union and East African Community efforts to achieve a lasting ceasefire and restricting all United States security assistance and cooperation to the Government of Rwanda until the Secretary of State certifies to the appropriate committees of Congress that Rwanda has terminated any and all military support for the M23;
(4) use existing sanctions authorities authorized by the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (22 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.) against perpetrators of corruption or human rights violations in the DRC;
(5) support efforts to accurately oversee, monitor, and prevent labor and human rights abuses in the DRC’s mining industry in order to remove child and slave labor from United States supply chains, including by encouraging the Government of the DRC to support the formalization of artisanal and small scale mining;
(6) engage with the Government of the DRC to address factors, including opaque business and taxation practices, and unpredictable administrative requirements, that limit United States investment and constrain the ability of the United States and DRC to strengthen economic cooperation;
(7) require institutions including the Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development, the Development Finance Corporation, and the Department of Commerce to identify opportunities to increase the amount of United States investment in the DRC’s critical minerals sector; and
(8) recognize that the PRC’s influence over the DRC’s mining sector output and processing is of concern to the economic and national security of the United States.5. National strategy to ensure a continued role in the drc’s critical mineral sector
