1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Peer-Reviewed Report on Measuring Metrics and Thresholds.2. Report on system for measuring aviation noise
(a) In general
Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall seek to enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in which the National Academies shall produce a report that identifies and recommends a system of measuring aviation noise that—
(1) with a highly reliable relationship, categorizes noise levels to determine compatibility for residential areas and high annoyance areas based on appropriate metrics; and
(2) meets the requirements of section 47502(1) of title 49, United States Code. (b) Requirements
In producing the report required under subsection (a), the National Academies shall—
(1) consult—(A) multidisciplinary experts from public health and medical professions;(B) sleep experts;(C) noise experts; and(D) acoustical engineers; and
(2) consider—(A) the Neighborhood Environmental Study conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration;(B) multiple metrics for measuring aviation noise, including—(i) N-Above;(ii) T-Above;(iii) Time-Above-Ambient;(iv) C-weighted dB; and(v) day-night average sound level between 40 and 75 dB;(C) the difference between local noise environments, including ambient noise, and aircraft-induced noise;(D) nighttime noise; and (E) the effects of frequent and persistent noise events and the effects on next generation air transportation system technology; and
(3) address whether the metrics used to determine whether a change in noise levels in a next generation air transportation system has a significant or reportable impact on such system are appropriate metrics to be used in the system of measuring aviation noise described in subsection (a).
