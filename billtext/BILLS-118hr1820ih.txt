Congress finds the following: 
(1) In 1960, Corona established the Corona Municipal Airport to provide recreational opportunities for aviators throughout southern California.

(2) The City of Corona initially entered into a lease agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on December 24, 1959. 
(3) The City’s lease with the Corps of Engineers enabled the construction of the airport into its current configuration.

(4) For over 60 years, the Corona Municipal Airport has supported local businesses, tourism, and recreation for local residents and the region. 
(5) The Corona Municipal Airport maintains the capability to assist in public safety efforts to protect life and property where aviation assets may be necessary.

(6) The Corona Municipal Airport supports approximately one dozen local, small businesses. 
(7) The Corona Municipal Airport continues to drive business development and local tourism for the City of Corona and connect people throughout southern California to those opportunities.

(8) The City of Corona’s lease with the Corps of Engineers is set to expire on January 30, 2037, without an opportunity to grandfather the facility under existing policies. 
(9) The closure of the Corona Municipal Airport would deprive aviators of significant opportunities to enjoy this recreation pastime as fewer small, recreational airports in the region remain open and accessible.

(10) Extending the City’s lease with the Corps of Engineers would allow this culturally and economically significant facility to continue serving aviators in the region. 2. Corona Airport Lease Renewal, Prado Dam, CA
