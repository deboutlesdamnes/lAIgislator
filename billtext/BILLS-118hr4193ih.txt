This Act may be cited as the Fly Together Act. 2. Family seating
 (a) In general
Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish a policy directing air carriers that assign seats, or allow individuals to select seats in advance of the date of departure of a flight, to sit each young child adjacent to an accompanying adult, to the greatest extent practicable, if adjacent seat assignments are available at any time after the ticket is issued for each young child and before the first passenger boards the flight.
(b) Prohibition on fees
The notice of proposed rulemaking described in subsection (a) shall include a provision that prohibits an air carrier from charging a fee, or imposing an additional cost beyond the ticket price of the additional seat, to seat each young child adjacent to an accompanying adult within the same class of service. (c) Rule of construction
Notwithstanding the requirement in subsection (a), nothing in this section may be construed to allow the Secretary to impose a change in the overall seating or boarding policy of an air carrier that has an open or flexible seating policy in place that generally allows adjacent family seating as described under this section.
(d) Young child
In this section, the term young child means an individual who has not attained 14 years of age.
