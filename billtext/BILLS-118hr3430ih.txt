1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Spectrum Relocation Enhancement Act.2. Federal spectrum relocation and sharing
(a) Relocation or sharing costs To satisfy operational requirements of Federal entities

(1) In general
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) is amended—(A) in section 113(g)—(i) in paragraph (3)—(I) in the first sentence of subparagraph (A), by striking in order to achieve comparable capability of systems as before the relocation or sharing arrangement and inserting to deploy systems that satisfy the operational requirements of such entity, which may have increased from the operational requirements being met before the relocation or sharing arrangement; and(II) by amending subparagraph (B) to read as follows:(B) Increased operational requirements
For purposes of subparagraph (A), paragraph (6), and section 118(f)(2)(B)(ii), the operational requirements of a Federal entity do not include any increased operational requirements the costs of which jeopardize the opportunity for a successful auction, sharing, or other non-Federal use of the eligible frequencies involved.; and(ii) in paragraph (6)—(I) in the first sentence, by striking of comparable capability and inserting that meet the operational requirements of such entities; and (II) in the second sentence, by striking a Federal entity has achieved comparable capability of systems and inserting the operational requirements of a Federal entity are met; and(B) in section 118(f)(2)(B)(ii), by striking to achieve comparable capability of systems affected by the reallocation of eligible frequencies from Federal use to exclusive non-Federal use or to shared use and inserting to deploy systems that satisfy the operational requirements of the eligible Federal entity.
(2) Applicability
The amendments made by paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to relocation or sharing costs, or payments under section 118(f) of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 928(f)), as the case may be, with respect to a transition plan that is found to be sufficient under section 113(h)(4) of such Act (47 U.S.C. 923(h)(4)) after the date of the enactment of this Act.(b) Payments from Spectrum Relocation Fund for research and development and planning activities
