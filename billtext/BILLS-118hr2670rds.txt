(2) the 2002 Memorandum of Agreement signed between the Department of Defense and Department of Transporatation regarding Link 16 use in the 960–1215 MHz frequency band, resulted in the Departments jointly developing a methodology to facilitate Electromagnectic Compatability Features (EMCF) certification which ensures frequency deconfliction of Link 16 from air traffic systems;
(3) in 2009 the Department of Defense was endorsed to certify all future Link 16 terminals, eliminating the need for NTIA EMCF demonstrations;
(4) recent issues between Department of Defense and Federal Aviaiton Administration coordination over Electromagnetic Compatability Features along with the expanded use of software defined radios and agile software practices within the Department of Defense have caused significant delays to needed national security capabilities, detremintal training impacts, Department of Defense safety risks that adversely impact national security, incur excess taxpayer expense, and make current certification processes incompatable with maintaining spectrum dominance over adversary nations;
(5) the Department of Defense is responsible for the testing of numerous systems and has the requesit knowledge, experience, and expertise to conduct self-certification of Department radio systems and are currently performing the testing required to support radio system certification;
(6) only those changes, hardware or software based, that impact EMCF of a Department of Defense radio should require recertification IAW Appendix A of The Department of Defense and Department of Transportation Memorandum of Agreement Regarding the 960–1215 MHz Frequency Band and that the weapon system program manager is best positioned to make the determination of any impacts hardware or software changes may have;
(7) the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System/Multi-Function Information Distribution System (Link 16) Certification of Spectrum Support and NTIA Manual of Regulations for Federal Radiofrequency Spectrum Management grants approval for uncoordinated operations of Link 16 systems if meeting certain restrictions; authorizing the Department of Defenese to internally manage Link 16 use on certified systems subject to documented restrictions;
(8) Link 16 use not meeting requirements for uncoordinated operations can be approved if coordinated with the FAA;
(9) in over 45 years of use, there are no recorded instances of Department of Defense use of Link 16 causing interference with air traffic systems; and
(10) as agreed to by both the Department of Defense and Federal Aviation Administration, Link 16 policies must be updated to keep pace with agile development practices and ensure safe and effective spectrum dominance for national defense.(b) Policies required
The Secretary of Defense shall develop and implement policies to adapt Link 16 system management and certification to align with agile development practices.(c) Elements

(2) Processes to streamline approval or denial of temporary frequency assignment for Link 16 operations to not more than 15 days for test, training, and large-scale exercises.(A) Such processes shall cover operations in excess of uncoordinated operations time slot duty factor limits, inclusion of foreign participants, and participation of non-stage 4 approved terminals or platforms.(B) Consideration shall be given to delegation of sole authority for temporary frequency assignment to the Department of Defense and the automation of such decision-making process.
(3) Delegation of authority to the system program manager to determine when new software within Department Link 16 terminals affect electromagnetic compatibility features and requires recertification.
(4) The self-certification of Department radio compliance with electromagnetic compatibility features.
(5) Processes to internally manage Link 16 uncoordinated operations that enable approval for test, training, and exercises that does not exceed 15 days for systems holding an active radio frequency authorization or temporary frequency assignment.(d) Information to Congress

Congress recognizes the following acts of valor by Thomas Helmut Griffin:
(1) Thomas Helmut Griffin distinguished himself by valorous actions against overwhelming odds while serving as a captain in the Army, Senior Advisor, 4/5 Infantry Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division, Army of the Republic of Vietnam.
(2) From March 1, 1969 through March 3, 1969, during the Vietnam War, such battalion was ordered to forestall an imminent attack on Quang Ngai City threatened by units of the North Vietnamese Army (hereinafter, NVA). The 4/5 Battalion engaged unabatedly with an entrenched NVA regiment over the course of three days. Captain Griffin (hereinafter, CPT Griffin) risked his life and disregarded his personal safety, all above and beyond his duty, on some 20 occasions, to lead his battalion in the fight as well as direct gunships, air, and artillery strikes on the enemy positions.
(3) During the initial phase of battle, CPT Griffin made numerous trips across 50 meters of open ground, while under heavy automatic weapon, rocket, and small arms fire, to advise on the conduct of the battle and better direct strikes against enemy forces. Fearing slaughter of his soldiers, CPT Griffin, with one of his counterparts from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (hereinafter, ARVN), charged directly into heavy enemy fire and assaulted a machine gun bunker. CPT Griffin continued these runs, despite the enemy shooting the heels off CPT Griffin’s boots.
(4) After taking out the NVA bunker, CPT Griffin brandished the captured machine gun and rocket launcher to exhort his battalion out of the kill zone and continue the assault into the enemy entrenchments while remaining exposed to heavy fire. CPT Griffin’s raw and intense close combat leadership galvanized his battalion to move out of the kill zone and continue their mission.

(2) Congress notes that although CPT Griffin was struck three times by enemy fire, and at one point was completely surrounded by the enemy, he continued to fight and lead his battalion against devastating and overwhelming enemy fire.
(3) Congress notes that CPT Griffin’s Commanding Officer, Colonel Dean E. Hutter (ret.), sent a letter to the Department of the Army dated November 6, 2013, in which he accounts for the revelation of additional, substantive and material evidence not known at the time of the decision to award the Silver Star, and in which he describes as compelling the justice of upgrading CPT Griffin’s sustained and varied acts of combat valor to their rightful level of recognition, the Medal of Honor.
(4) Congress further notes that Colonel Hutter issued a letter to former United States Representative Sam Farr on September 15, 2011, noting his support for an upgrade from a Silver Star to a Medal of Honor, having recognized CPT Griffin’s acts of valor as, numerous, selfless demonstrations of personal risk in pressing a close-combat attack against a well-entrenched element of a battalion-size enemy formation.(c) Authorization of award of medal of honor to Thomas Helmut Griffin for acts of valor as a member of the Army during the Vietnam War

1231.  Statement of policy relating to NATO-Russia Founding Act
It is the policy of the United States that the agreement titled Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between NATO and the Russian Federation, done at Paris on May 27, 1997 (commonly referred to as the NATO-Russia Founding Act), does not—
(1) prohibit the establishment of a permanent presence of the United States Armed Forces in Europe; or
(2) constrain in any manner the deployment of United States Armed Forces or North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces.1232.  Strategy to delay, disrupt, and degrade Rosatom’s proliferation activities and other revenue streams
(a) Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy corporation, Rosatom, is providing the People’s Republic of China highly enriched uranium for Chinese Communist Party fast-breeder reactors. 
(2) The Department of Defense’s 2022 report to Congress on the Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China noted the key role that increased weapons-grade plutonium production is key to China’s nuclear program, stating: The PRC is also supporting this expansion by increasing its capacity to produce and separate plutonium by constructing fast breeder reactors and reprocessing facilities.. The report also cites the CFR-600 reactors and notes that each reactor will be capable of producing enough plutonium for dozens of nuclear warheads annually. This buildup puts China in violation of Article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, requiring states to make good-faith efforts to cease an arms race and to engage in good-faith arms control negotiations. 
(3) There are also credible reports that Russia’s state nuclear power conglomerate has been working to supply the Russian arms industry with components, technology and raw materials for missile(s). Specifically, a letter from a Rosatom department chief, dated October 2022, shows Rosatom offering to provide goods to Russian military units and to Russian weapons manufacturers that are under sanctions. 
(4) The United States Government has taken steps against Rosatom, such as sanctioning three Rosatom subsidiaries on February 24, 2023, and speaking out publicly against Rosatom’s behavior. 
(5) Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy, Dr. John F. Plumb, testified before the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces on March 8, 2023, that It’s very troubling to see Russia and China cooperating on this . . . They may have talking points around it, but there’s no getting around the fact that breeder reactors are plutonium, and plutonium is for weapons. So, I think the [Defense] Department is concerned. And of course, it matches our concerns about China’s increased expansion of its nuclear forces as well, because you need more plutonium for more weapons..(b) Strategy
Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Energy, with the assistance of the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a strategy to delay, disrupt, and degrade Rosatom’s and other Russian state-owned entities’ proliferation activities and other revenue streams that directly fund Russia’s military forces.(c) Appropriate congressional committees defined
In subsection (b), the term appropriate congressional committees means—
(1) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Committee on Financial Services, and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives; and

(4) the United States should pursue consistent efforts focused on defense and security assistance, coordination, and planning, such as the United States Baltic Dialogue, designed to ensure the continued security of the Baltic states and on deterring current and future challenges to the national sovereignty of United States allies and partners in the Baltic region;
(5) the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State should seek to require matching funds from those Baltic states in amounts commensurate with amounts provided.(b) Strategy
Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report setting forth a strategy to deepen security cooperation with the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to—

(a) Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) Restrictive housing takes many forms, and the experience in segregation can vary considerably depending on certain external factors, such as the length of stay, conditions of confinement, and degree of social isolation, as well as factors specific to each confined person, such as age and psychological resiliency.
(2) Confined individuals located in restrictive housing broadly express severe psychological disturbances with lasting detrimental consequences as a result of their experience in security housing units. The Stanford Lab’s interviews revealed a range of common impairments and adverse consequences associated with long-term, indefinite incarceration.
(3) The majority of confined members endorsed feeling mood symptoms consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5) diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, including depressed mood, hopelessness, anger, irritability, anhedonia, anger, fatigue, feelings of guilt, loss of appetite, and insomnia.
(4) Nearly all members also endorsed a sense of anxiety symptoms characteristic of DSM 5 diagnoses of panic disorder, traumatic stress disorders, or obsessive-compulsive disorders, such as nervousness, worry, increased heart rate and respiration, sweating, muscle tension, hyperarousal, paranoia, nightmares, intrusive thoughts, and fear of losing control.
(5) Psychiatric symptoms and diminished capacity for socialization continue to cause psychological suffering and problems with social function for most of the men now in general population.
(6) Confined members cited emotional numbing and desensitization as some of the most common responses to living in SHU.
(7) This sense of emotional suppression and dysregulation continues to be problematic for inmates following the transition to the general population. Class members also reported significant alterations in cognition and perception.
(8) Problems with attention, concentration, and memory were common, and described as persistent and worsening.
(9) Some of the most pronounced and enduring effects of long-term isolation appeared to have resulted from relational estrangement and social isolation; inmates frequently reported losing, over time, the motivation to seek social connection.(b) Limitations on confinement

(1) In general
Inmates shall be housed in the least restrictive setting necessary to ensure their own safety, as well as the safety of staff, other inmates, and the public.
(2) Reasoning
The head of a military correctional facility shall clearly articulate each specific reason for an inmate’s placement and retention in restrictive housing. Each such reason shall be supported by objective evidence that such placement and retention is necessary—(A) for prison safety or order;(B) to prevent gang influence;(C) for inmate or staff protection; and(D) such other penological purpose as the head of such facility may determine is appropriate.
(3) Penological purpose
Restrictive housing may only be used to eliminate or mitigate a specific facility threat such as a fight between inmates or the threat of imminent danger to inmates or staff.
(4) Limitation
(A) In general
Inmates shall remain in restrictive housing for no longer than necessary to address each specific reason for such placement.(B) Punishment
Inmates may not be placed in restrictive housing—(i) as a form of punishment or deterrence;(ii) for low-level offenses that do not involve physical violence to staff or inmates; or(iii) for more than 5 days as a part of a routine investigation or more than 15 days as part of a non-routine investigation, as determined by the Secretary of Defense, absent documented extenuating circumstances.(c) Review of placement

(1) In general
An institutional review panel of a military correctional facility shall review the placement of an inmate in restrictive housing not later than 15 days after such placement and not less than every 15 days thereafter until such time as the inmate is removed from restrictive housing.
(2) Removal plan
The head of each military correctional facility shall make a plan for the return of the inmate to less restrictive conditions and shall share such plan with the inmate, unless sharing such plan would put the health and safety of the inmate, staff, other inmates, or the public at risk.(d) Employee training

(1) In general
The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the staff of each military correctional facility is trained on use of force and restrictive housing policies not less than quarterly.
(2) Housing policy training
The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the staff of each military correctional facility complies with restrictive housing policies and that such policies are reflected in employee evaluation systems.
(3) Standing committees
