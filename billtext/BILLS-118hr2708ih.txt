The purposes of this Act are—
(1) to clarify and strengthen the integration mandate of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, held by the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) in a manner that accelerates and improves State compliance;
(2) to affirm that every individual who is eligible for long-term services and supports has a federally protected right to be meaningfully integrated into that individual’s community and receive community-based long-term services and supports;
