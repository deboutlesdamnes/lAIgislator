1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Visitable Inclusive Tax Credits for Accessible Living (VITAL) Act.2. Purpose
The purposes of this Act are to—
(1) increase low-income housing tax credits to increase the stock of disability-accessible and affordable housing;
(2) ensure that States are using the Federal tax credits to construct housing that will meet the needs of an aging population and currently underserved populations such as households with people with disabilities;
(3) encourage States to make sure older adults and underserved populations are integrated into their community and can fully participate in society; and
(4) increase technical assistance, awareness, knowledge, and understanding of the low-income housing credit program and the housing needs of older adults and people with disabilities. 3. Findings
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) By 2030, 1 in every 5 Americans will be over age 65, and currently, 2 in 5 adults over age 65 have a disability. As people age, they need structurally safe and functional housing that accommodates people with disabilities.
(2) Approximately 26 percent of people in the United States have a disability, yet less than 6 percent of the national housing supply is designed to be even rudimentarily accessible.
(3) An accessible home offers specific features or technologies such as lowered kitchen counters and sinks, widened doorways, and zero-step showers.
(4) A lack of affordable and accessible housing can relegate people with disabilities to living in institutional settings when they would prefer to live in a community setting.
(5) Older adults and people with disabilities prefer to remain in their homes for as long as possible. More than 89 percent of adults age 65 and over hope to stay in their homes as they age.
(6) Older adults and people with disabilities must be able to run errands, work, visit family and friends, and keep doctor appointments, while not always being able to drive. Accessible and affordable public transit options and walkable and roll-able neighborhoods allow older adults to remain independent and active in their communities.
(7) Many older adults and people with disabilities are experiencing an affordability crisis. Approximately 4,800,000 non-institutionalized people with disabilities who depend on Federal monthly Supplemental Security Income have incomes averaging only about $9,156 per year, low enough to be priced out of every rental housing market in the nation. 4.
