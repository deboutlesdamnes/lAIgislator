1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Precipitation Forecasting for Agriculture Act.2. Central United States precipitation pilot project
Subsection (h) of section 1762 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (15 U.S.C. 8521) is amended to read as follows:(h) Subseasonal to seasonal forecasting pilot projects

(1) Establishment
The Under Secretary shall establish at least one pilot project within the U.S. Weather Research Program of the Oceanic and Atmospheric Research office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to support improved subseasonal to seasonal precipitation forecasts for agriculture in the central United States.
(2) Objectives
In carrying out this subsection, the Under Secretary shall ensure that a pilot project under paragraph (1) addresses key science challenges to improving forecasts and developing related products described in subsection (c) for agriculture in the central United States, including the following:(A) Improving observations and accurate modeling of the land surface and hydrologic cycle, such as soil moisture and flash drought processes.(B) Improving fidelity in modeling of warm season precipitation processes.(C) Understanding and predicting large-scale upper-level dynamical flow anomalies that occur in spring and summer.
(3) Activities
A pilot project under this subsection shall include activities that carry out the following:(A) Best implement recommendations of the National Weather Serviceâ€™s 2019 Report, entitled Subseasonal and Seasonal Forecasting Innovation: Plans for the Twenty-First Century.(B) Achieve measurable objectives for operational forecast improvement.(C) Engage with, and leverage the resources of, entities within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in existence as of the date of the enactment of this subsection, including the Midwestern Regional Climate Center and the National Centers for Environmental Information.(D) Are carried out in coordination with the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and the Director of the National Weather Service.
(4) Authorization of appropriations
From amounts made available to Operations, Research, and Facilities at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there is authorized to be appropriated $15,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2024 through 2028 to carry out this subsection.
(5) Sunset
The authority under this subsection shall terminate on the date that is five years after the date of the enactment of this subsection..
