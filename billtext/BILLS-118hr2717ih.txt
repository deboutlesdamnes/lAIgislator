This Act may be cited as the Hershel Woody Williams National Medal of Honor Monument Location Act.2. Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) Congress in 2021 unanimously passed, and the President signed, Public Law 117–80 (40 U.S.C. 8903 note), which authorized the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation to establish on Federal land in the District of Columbia a commemorative work to honor the acts of valor, selfless service, and sacrifice displayed by Medal of Honor recipients.
(2) The Medal of Honor was established by President Abraham Lincoln and first awarded 160 years ago on March 25, 1863, and is part of Lincoln’s lasting and living legacy.
(3) In 1991, during the administration of President George H.W. Bush, this legacy was extended further when National Medal of Honor Day was established as March 25th of each year.
(4) The Medal of Honor is awarded to all branches of the United States Armed Forces as our nation’s highest recognition for valor in combat.
(5) The number of living Medal of Honor recipients has been steadily declining, making it even more crucial to honor and recognize their heroic sacrifices and inspire future generations.

(7) The Medal of Honor represents the very best of our Nation—ordinary citizens, who took extraordinary action above and beyond the call of duty and became heroes of our Republic.
(8) These examples inspire all citizens and ignite within us the very spirit of America.
(9) The Medal of Honor rises to the level of supreme national and historical importance necessary to warrant representation on the National Mall.3. National Medal of Honor Monument Location
