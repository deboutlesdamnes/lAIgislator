5. Sense of Congress encouraging States to adopt protections for victims of trafficking
Congress recognizes and applauds the State legislative bodies that have taken tremendous steps to adopt protections and services for victims of trafficking. Congress encourages States to— 
(1) uphold the dignity of human trafficking survivors;

(2) ensure the safety, confidentiality, and well-being of victims of trafficking, while recognizing symptoms of trauma and coping mechanisms that may impact victims’ interactions with law enforcement, the justice system, and service providers; 
(3) implement screening mechanisms to identify and extend appropriate services to children in the custody of child protective services agencies, the juvenile justice system, or the criminal justice system who are victims of trafficking;

(4) promote greater access to child welfare services for, rather than criminalization of, child victims of sex trafficking; 
(5) develop a 24-hour emergency response plan by which victims of human trafficking may receive immediate protection, shelter, and support from a victim assistance coordinator when those victims are first identified;

(6) adopt protections for adult victims of trafficking, such as protection if the victim’s safety is at risk, comprehensive trauma-informed, long-term, culturally competent care and healing services, mental health services to relieve traumatic stress, housing, education (including, where appropriate, vocational training and employment assistance), mentoring, language assistance, drug and substance abuse services, and legal services; 
(7) ensure that child sex trafficking victims are treated as children in need of child protective services and receive appropriate care in the child welfare, rather than juvenile justice, system;

(8) encourage the adoption of procedures for human trafficking victims that are consistent with those afforded to victims of sexual assault, rape, child sexual abuse, or incest to allow human trafficking victims to clear records, expunge convictions, and vacate adjudications related to prostitution and nonviolent offenses that arose as a direct result of being trafficked, including protections for foreign nationals who are being removed and those who are losing or determined to be inadmissible for immigration benefits as a result of the aforementioned human trafficking victim related conviction or arrest; and 
(9) ensure victims of trafficking, including United States citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals are eligible for services.
