1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Nuclear Fuel Security Act.2. U.S. nuclear fuel security initiative
(a) Sense of Congress
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the Department should—(A) prioritize activities to increase domestic production of low-enriched uranium; and (B) accelerate efforts to establish a domestic high-assay, low-enriched uranium enrichment capability; and
(2) if domestic enrichment of high-assay, low-enriched uranium will not be commercially available at the scale needed in time to meet the needs of the advanced nuclear reactor demonstration projects of the Department, the Secretary shall consider and implement, as necessary—(A) all viable options to make high-assay, low-enriched uranium produced from inventories owned by the Department available in a manner that is sufficient to maximize the potential for the Department to meet the needs and schedules of advanced nuclear reactor developers, without impacting existing Department missions, until such time that commercial enrichment and deconversion capability for high-assay, low-enriched uranium exists at a scale sufficient to meet future needs; and(B) all viable options for partnering with countries that are allies or partners of the United States to meet those needs and schedules until that time.(b) Objectives
The objectives of this section are—
(1) to expeditiously increase domestic production of low-enriched uranium;
(2) to expeditiously increase domestic production of high-assay, low-enriched uranium by an annual quantity, and in such form, determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to meet the needs of—(A) advanced nuclear reactor developers; and(B) the consortium;
(3) to ensure the availability of domestically produced, converted, and enriched uranium in a quantity determined by the Secretary, in consultation with U.S. nuclear energy companies, to be sufficient to address a reasonably anticipated supply disruption;
(4) to address gaps and deficiencies in the domestic production, conversion, enrichment, deconversion, and reduction of uranium by partnering with countries that are allies or partners of the United States if domestic options are not practicable;
(5) to ensure that, in the event of a supply disruption in the nuclear fuel market, a reserve of nuclear fuels is available to serve as a backup supply to support the nuclear nonproliferation and civil nuclear energy objectives of the Department;
(6) to support enrichment, deconversion, and reduction technology deployed in the United States; and
(7) to ensure that, until such time that domestic enrichment and deconversion of high-assay, low-enriched uranium is commercially available at the scale needed to meet the needs of advanced nuclear reactor developers, the Secretary considers and implements, as necessary—(A) all viable options to make high-assay, low-enriched uranium produced from inventories owned by the Department available in a manner that is sufficient to maximize the potential for the Department to meet the needs and schedules of advanced nuclear reactor developers; and(B) all viable options for partnering with countries that are allies or partners of the United States to meet those needs and schedules.

(1) Activities
On enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall immediately accelerate and, as necessary, initiate activities to make available from inventories or stockpiles owned by the Department and made available to the consortium, HALEU for use in advanced nuclear reactors that cannot operate on uranium with lower enrichment levels or on alternate fuels, with priority given to the awards made pursuant to the funding opportunity announcement of the Department numbered DE–FOA–0002271 for Pathway 1, Advanced Reactor Demonstrations, with additional HALEU to be made available to other advanced nuclear reactor developers, as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.
(2) Quantity
In carrying out activities under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider and implement, as necessary, all viable options to make HALEU available in quantities and forms sufficient to maximize the potential for the Department to meet the needs and schedules of advanced nuclear reactor developers, including by seeking to make available—(A) by September 30, 2024, not less than 3 metric tons of HALEU;(B) by December 31, 2025, not less than an additional 8 metric tons of HALEU; and(C) by June 30, 2026, not less than an additional 10 metric tons of HALEU.
