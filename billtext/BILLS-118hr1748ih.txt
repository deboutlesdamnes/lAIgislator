
1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Quantum in Practice Act.  2. Findings
Congress finds the following:

(1) Quantum computing has the potential to spur advancements in molecular modeling and simulation that will benefit Americans. 
(2) Quantum molecular simulations and modeling will enable scientists to study chemical elements and reactions with accuracy and speed that is far beyond the abilities of existing supercomputers.

(3) Advances in molecular simulations and modeling would give researchers tools that could lead to breakthroughs across industries and sectors, including— (A) modeling the nitrogen fixation process utilized by bacteria, which could be used to develop synthetic fertilizers without the high energy and material costs of current methods, creating the next generation of fertilizers;
(B) creating more effective medications and reducing harmful interactions or side effects; (C) developing new materials to increase energy storage capacity and create more powerful battery technologies;
(D) developing lighter, stronger metals; (E) creating materials for more durable protective gear for law enforcement and military; and
(F) developing new types of superconductors. 3. Quantum modeling and simulation
 (a) Definition of quantum information science
