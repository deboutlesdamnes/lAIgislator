1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Upholding Sovereignty of Airspace Act or the USA Act.2. Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) According to the Department of State, surveillance balloons owned and operated by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) have entered United States airspace multiple times since 2017 and have violated the airspace of more than 40 countries across 5 continents.
(2) On February 10, 2023, the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security issued a final rule (88 Fed. Reg. 9389) that added 6 PRC entities to the Entity List for supporting the PRC’s military modernization efforts related to aerospace programs, including airships and balloons and related materials and components, that are used by the People’s Liberation Army for intelligence and reconnaissance.
(3) The PRC’s response has been to use misinformation and propaganda to deflect blame for the illegal surveillance activities of these balloons.3. Sense of Congress
 It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the presence of the PRC’s high altitude surveillance balloon over United States airspace was an unacceptable violation of United States sovereignty;
(2) the United States should continue to neutralize foreign aerial surveillance assets that are in United States airspace after consideration of civilian aviation safety, safety of United States civilians and property on the ground, as well as the intelligence collection risk and opportunity posed by such intrusions;
(3) the PRC’s global balloon surveillance program blatantly undermines countries’ sovereignty and poses a threat to countries around the world;
(4) the PRC should cease efforts to spread misinformation and propaganda about its intelligence-collection efforts;
(5) the United States Government should continue to share information about the PRC’s global surveillance efforts with allies and partners and should work jointly to hold the PRC accountable for its illegal surveillance actions, including at multilateral fora;
(6) the United Nations should condemn the PRC’s violation, through its global surveillance balloon program, of the sovereignty of member states of the United Nations and call on the PRC to ensure its balloons do not violate sovereign airspace again;
(7) the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) should condemn the PRC for this violation of airspace and the PRC’s ICAO commitments; and
(8) as consistent with international law, the United States should use regulatory and enforcement tools to protect national security and sovereignty by identifying and disrupting the PRC’s use of surveillance balloons.4. International coordination and pressure

(4) using the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United Nations and other international and regional organizations to spur greater diplomatic pressure on the PRC to halt its surveillance collection operations that violate international sovereignty;
(5) raising the challenges posed by the PRC’s global surveillance balloon program at major multilateral forums, including at the G7 and G20 summits; and
