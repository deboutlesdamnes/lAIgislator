1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Advanced, Local Emergency Response Telecommunications Parity Act or the ALERT Parity Act.2. Emergency connectivity service
(a) Rulemaking required

(1) In general
Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Commission shall issue rules for the provision of emergency connectivity service under which—(A) a person may submit to the Commission an application for approval to provide such service to an area—(i) that is an unserved area with respect to either or both services described in subsection (i)(5)(B); or(ii) in the event that such area becomes an unserved area with respect to either or both such services due to destruction of infrastructure, a power outage, or any other reason; and(B) for any period during which such approval is in effect and such area is an unserved area, such person will receive access to electromagnetic spectrum in accordance with subsection (d) to provide emergency connectivity service to such area.
(2) Provider not licensee
The Commission shall include in the rules issued under paragraph (1) language to ensure that approval of an application to provide emergency connectivity service under such rules does not render the provider of such service a licensee (as such term is defined in section 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 153)).
(3) Deadline to initiate rulemaking
The Commission shall initiate a rulemaking to issue the rules required by paragraph (1) not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.(b) Demonstrations
In the rules issued under subsection (a), the Commission shall require a person who submits an application to provide emergency connectivity service under such rules, in order for such application to be approved, to demonstrate to the Commission the following:
(1) Such person has a technical proposal describing how such person plans to provide such service and how the proposal complies with technical requirements included in such rules under subsection (d)(2).
(2) Such person will not use any electromagnetic spectrum to which access is made available under such rules to provide any service other than emergency connectivity service, unless the other service is provided under a separate authorization to use such spectrum held by such person.
(3) Such service proposed can withstand the impact of major natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, floods, blizzards, and tornados.
(4) Such person has the capability to begin providing such service in a rapid manner—(A) in the case of an application to provide such service to an area that is an unserved area at the time at which the application is submitted, after the approval of the application; or(B) in the case of an application to provide such service to an area in the event that such area becomes an unserved area due to destruction of infrastructure, a power outage, or any other reason, after such area becomes an unserved area.(c) Publication of list of providers
The Commission shall publish on the internet website of the Commission a list of all providers of emergency connectivity service for which an approval is in effect to provide such service under the rules issued under subsection (a).(d) Access to electromagnetic spectrum
The Commission shall include in the rules issued under subsection (a) the following:
(1) In the case of a provider of emergency connectivity service that is approved to provide such service to an area under such rules and that seeks access to spectrum that another entity is authorized to use, access to such spectrum shall be made available to such provider only if such provider receives voluntary express written consent for such access from such entity. An entity that receives a request for consent under this paragraph shall reasonably engage with the provider submitting the request and make a determination with respect to such request in a timely manner.
(2) With respect to providers of emergency connectivity service that are approved to provide such service to an area under such rules, technical requirements applicable to such providers that ensure that the use of electromagnetic spectrum under a relevant approval does not cause harmful interference to the use of spectrum by another entity authorized to provide a service to such area or an adjacent geographic area.(e) Areas unserved with respect to both services
In the case of an area that is an unserved area with respect to both services described in subsection (i)(5)(B), the rules issued under subsection (a) shall require that, if a provider approved to provide emergency connectivity service to such area under such rules chooses to provide emergency connectivity service to such area, such provider shall provide both services described in subsection (i)(5)(B) to such area.(f) Limitation of liability

(1) Transmission of alert messages
Section 602(e)(1) of the Warning, Alert, and Response Network Act (47 U.S.C. 1201(e)(1)) shall apply to a provider of emergency connectivity service (including its officers, directors, employees, vendors, and agents) with respect to the provision of such service (to the extent such service consists of the provision of the service described in subsection (i)(5)(B)(i) of this section) in accordance with the rules issued under subsection (a) of this section, as if such provider were a provider of commercial mobile service that transmits emergency alerts and meets its obligations under such Act.
(2) Provision of 9–1–1 service
