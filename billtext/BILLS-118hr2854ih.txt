Congress finds the following: 
(1) April 25 of each year is recognized internationally as World Malaria Day.

(2) Malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in many developing countries, with nearly half of all cases globally occurring in only 4 countries, despite being preventable and treatable. 
(3) At the end of 2021, there were an estimated 247,000,000 malaria cases in 84 endemic countries and 619,000 deaths from malaria.

(4) Between 2019 and 2021, an estimated additional 13,400,000 cases and 63,000 deaths were attributed to disruptions during that period of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
(5) Young children and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to, and disproportionately affected by, malaria, with children under the age of 5 accounting for 76 percent of malaria deaths each year.

(6) Malaria was once a leading cause of death in the United States. 
(7) Fighting malaria is in the national interest of the United States because reducing the risk of malaria protects members of the Armed Forces and other people of the United States serving overseas in malaria-endemic regions, and reducing malaria deaths helps to lower risks of instability in less developed countries.

(8) United States support for efforts to fight malaria— (A) is in the diplomatic and moral interests of the United States;
(B) generates goodwill toward the United States; and (C) highlights the values of the people of the United States through the work of governmental, nongovernmental, and faith-based organizations of the United States.

(9) Global investments made in malaria intervention programs have averted an estimated 2,000,000,000 malaria cases and 11,700,000 malaria deaths between 2000 and 2021. 
(10) The United States Government has played a leading role in the recent progress made toward reducing the global burden of malaria, particularly through the President’s Malaria Initiative and the contribution of the United States to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

(11) In fiscal year 2021, the President’s Malaria Initiative protected nearly 100,000,000 people with insecticide-treated bed nets, more than 21,000,000 people with indoor insecticide spraying, more than 8,000,000 children with seasonal preventive treatments, and more than 5,000,000 women with preventive treatments in pregnancy. 
(12) The United States is the largest donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and every $1 contributed by the United States leverages an additional $2 from other donors, as required by law.

(13) The United States Government is pursuing a comprehensive approach to ending malaria deaths through the President’s Malaria Initiative, led by the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development and implemented with assistance from the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, the Secretary of Defense, and private sector entities.  2. Sense of Congress
It is the sense of Congress to—

(1) support the goals and ideals of World Malaria Day; 
(2) recognize the importance of reducing malaria prevalence and deaths to improve overall child and maternal health in all endemic regions, especially in sub-Saharan Africa;

(3) commend the recent progress made toward reducing global malaria morbidity, mortality, and prevalence, particularly through the efforts of the President’s Malaria Initiative and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; 
(4) commend the efforts and achievements in preventing and treating malaria by endemic countries through the national malaria control programs of such countries;

(5) welcome ongoing public-private partnerships to research and develop more effective and affordable tools for malaria prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination; 
(6) recognize the goals, priorities, and authorities to combat malaria set forth in the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–293; 122 Stat. 2918);

(7) support efforts to reduce malaria case incidence and malaria mortality rates by at least 90 percent by 2030; 
(8) support continued leadership by the United States in bilateral, multilateral, and private sector efforts to combat malaria and to work with developing countries to create long-term strategies to increase ownership over malaria programs; and

(9) encourage other members of the international community to sustain and increase their support for, and financial contributions to, efforts to combat malaria worldwide. 3. Reporting requirement
Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development shall submit to Congress a report on the cumulative progress toward 90 percent malaria reduction by 2030, including by providing incidence and mortality rates of malaria.
