
1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Technology Assessment for Air Quality Management Act of 2023. 2. Findings
Congress finds that—

(1) the Environmental Protection Agency can further strengthen air quality planning and management by consistently gathering information on local air quality monitoring systems across the United States; 
(2) newer air sensor technologies create the possibility for enhanced, community-scale air pollution data;

(3) despite national progress in reducing air pollution, more than 40 percent of people in the United States live in places with unhealthy levels of ozone or particle pollution; 
(4) people of color, Indigenous people, and low-income communities bear disproportionately higher exposures and health burdens due to air pollution;

(5) air quality can vary up to 800 percent from block to block within a single neighborhood; and 
(6) existing methods that are prescribed for basin-wide air quality monitoring are cost-prohibitive for monitoring community-scale air quality.
