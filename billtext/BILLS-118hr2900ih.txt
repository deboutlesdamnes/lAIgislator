1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Apprenticeship Hubs Across America Act of 2023.2. Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) Registered apprenticeship programs provide apprentices employment with structured on-the-job training, little to no student loan debt, competitive wages, industry-recognized credentials, direct access to jobs and careers, and in some cases, the potential to earn college credit toward an associate’s or bachelor’s degree.
(2) According to the Department of Labor, the average salary for an individual who completes an apprenticeship program is $77,000 annually. Apprentices who complete their program earn approximately $300,000 more during their career than peers who did not complete an apprenticeship.
(3) There are still very few apprenticeship positions in sectors with high projected job growth. According to data from the Department of Labor, professional, scientific, and technical services—all industries with high projected job growth—had only 1,827 apprentices in fiscal year 2021. The field of health care and social assistance had less than 14,000 apprentices, much lower than the future projected need in the field.
(4) A major barrier to expanding registered apprenticeships in high-growth job sectors is employers’ lack of familiarity with the process to establish, and the requirements of, registered apprenticeship programs.
(5) Workforce intermediaries, which are organizations at the national, regional, State, or local level that help ease the process for employers in developing and delivering new registered apprenticeship programs, can serve as a catalyzing force for creating and expanding registered apprenticeships in high-growth job sectors through technical assistance and capacity building for employers, labor organizations, educational institutions, and government entities.3.
