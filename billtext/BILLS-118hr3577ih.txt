(3) Participation by private entities
The application established under paragraph (1) shall support the voluntary sharing of data and accessing data by private health care supply chain entities, by allowing such entities to display near real-time data relating to inventory and time estimates for when inventories may be replenished.
(4) Annual exercise
The Assistant Secretary shall provide for an annual exercise hosted by the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response to test the effectiveness of the application established under paragraph (1), and to provide an opportunity to report, not later than 180 days after publication of the standards described in paragraph (2)(C), any inefficiencies or deficiencies in the application.
(5) Program of support
The Assistant Secretary shall establish a program to assist State, local, and private health care entities, such as rural, critical access, or community hospitals, that do not have an automated vendor management system in developing or obtaining such a system.
