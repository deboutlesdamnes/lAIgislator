D Matters relating to Russia, Europe, and NATO

1231.  Statement of policy relating to NATO-Russia Founding Act
It is the policy of the United States that the agreement titled Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between NATO and the Russian Federation, done at Paris on May 27, 1997 (commonly referred to as the NATO-Russia Founding Act), does not— 
(1) prohibit the establishment of a permanent presence of the United States Armed Forces in Europe; or

(2) constrain in any manner the deployment of United States Armed Forces or North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces. 1232.  Strategy to delay, disrupt, and degrade Rosatom’s proliferation activities and other revenue streams
 (a) Findings
Congress finds the following:

(1) Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy corporation, Rosatom, is providing the People’s Republic of China highly enriched uranium for Chinese Communist Party fast-breeder reactors.  
(2) The Department of Defense’s 2022 report to Congress on the Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China noted the key role that increased weapons-grade plutonium production is key to China’s nuclear program, stating: The PRC is also supporting this expansion by increasing its capacity to produce and separate plutonium by constructing fast breeder reactors and reprocessing facilities.. The report also cites the CFR-600 reactors and notes that each reactor will be capable of producing enough plutonium for dozens of nuclear warheads annually. This buildup puts China in violation of Article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, requiring states to make good-faith efforts to cease an arms race and to engage in good-faith arms control negotiations. 

(3) There are also credible reports that Russia’s state nuclear power conglomerate has been working to supply the Russian arms industry with components, technology and raw materials for missile(s). Specifically, a letter from a Rosatom department chief, dated October 2022, shows Rosatom offering to provide goods to Russian military units and to Russian weapons manufacturers that are under sanctions.  
(4) The United States Government has taken steps against Rosatom, such as sanctioning three Rosatom subsidiaries on February 24, 2023, and speaking out publicly against Rosatom’s behavior. 

(5) Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy, Dr. John F. Plumb, testified before the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces on March 8, 2023, that It’s very troubling to see Russia and China cooperating on this …They may have talking points around it, but there’s no getting around the fact that breeder reactors are plutonium, and plutonium is for weapons. So, I think the [Defense] Department is concerned. And of course, it matches our concerns about China’s increased expansion of its nuclear forces as well, because you need more plutonium for more weapons.. (b) Strategy
Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Energy, with the assistance of the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a strategy to delay, disrupt, and degrade Rosatom’s and other Russian state-owned entities’ proliferation activities and other revenue streams that directly fund Russia’s military forces.
(c) Appropriate congressional committees defined
In subsection (b), the term appropriate congressional committees means— 
(1) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Committee on Financial Services, and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives; and 

(2) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate. 1233.  Baltic Security Initiative

(3) the Baltic states are model NATO allies in terms of burden sharing, investing over 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense expenditure, allocating over 20 percent of their defense budgets on capital modernization, matching security assistance from the United States, frequently deploying their forces around the world in support of allied and United States objectives, and sharing diplomatic, technical, military, and analytical expertise on defense and security matters; 
(4) the United States should pursue consistent efforts focused on defense and security assistance, coordination, and planning, such as the United States Baltic Dialogue, designed to ensure the continued security of the Baltic states and on deterring current and future challenges to the national sovereignty of United States allies and partners in the Baltic region;

(5) the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State should seek to require matching funds from those Baltic states in amounts commensurate with amounts provided. (b) Strategy
Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report setting forth a strategy to deepen security cooperation with the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to—

(1) achieve United States national security strategy objectives; 
(2) enhance regional planning and cooperation among Baltic states, particularly with respect to long-term regional capability projects; and

(3) enhance the Baltic states’ defenses and resiliency. (c) Appropriate congressional committees defined
In this section, the term appropriate congressional committees means—

1855. Restrictive housing reform

(a) Findings
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Restrictive housing takes many forms, and the experience in segregation can vary considerably depending on certain external factors, such as the length of stay, conditions of confinement, and degree of social isolation, as well as factors specific to each confined person, such as age and psychological resiliency.

(2) Confined individuals located in restrictive housing broadly express severe psychological disturbances with lasting detrimental consequences as a result of their experience in security housing units. The Stanford Lab’s interviews revealed a range of common impairments and adverse consequences associated with long-term, indefinite incarceration. 
(3) The majority of confined members endorsed feeling mood symptoms consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5) diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, including depressed mood, hopelessness, anger, irritability, anhedonia, anger, fatigue, feelings of guilt, loss of appetite, and insomnia.

(4) Nearly all members also endorsed a sense of anxiety symptoms characteristic of DSM 5 diagnoses of panic disorder, traumatic stress disorders, or obsessive-compulsive disorders, such as nervousness, worry, increased heart rate and respiration, sweating, muscle tension, hyperarousal, paranoia, nightmares, intrusive thoughts, and fear of losing control. 
(5) Psychiatric symptoms and diminished capacity for socialization continue to cause psychological suffering and problems with social function for most of the men now in general population.

(6) Confined members cited emotional numbing and desensitization as some of the most common responses to living in SHU. 
(7) This sense of emotional suppression and dysregulation continues to be problematic for inmates following the transition to the general population. Class members also reported significant alterations in cognition and perception.

(8) Problems with attention, concentration, and memory were common, and described as persistent and worsening. 
(9) Some of the most pronounced and enduring effects of long-term isolation appeared to have resulted from relational estrangement and social isolation; inmates frequently reported losing, over time, the motivation to seek social connection.
(b) Limitations on confinement


(1) In general
Inmates shall be housed in the least restrictive setting necessary to ensure their own safety, as well as the safety of staff, other inmates, and the public. 
(2) Reasoning
The head of a military correctional facility shall clearly articulate each specific reason for an inmate’s placement and retention in restrictive housing. Each such reason shall be supported by objective evidence that such placement and retention is necessary—
(A) for prison safety or order; (B) to prevent gang influence;
(C) for inmate or staff protection; and (D) such other penological purpose as the head of such facility may determine is appropriate.

(3) Penological purpose
Restrictive housing may only be used to eliminate or mitigate a specific facility threat such as a fight between inmates or the threat of imminent danger to inmates or staff. 
(4) Limitation
 (A) In general
Inmates shall remain in restrictive housing for no longer than necessary to address each specific reason for such placement.
(B) Punishment
Inmates may not be placed in restrictive housing— (i) as a form of punishment or deterrence;
(ii) for low-level offenses that do not involve physical violence to staff or inmates; or (iii) for more than 5 days as a part of a routine investigation or more than 15 days as part of a non-routine investigation, as determined by the Secretary of Defense, absent documented extenuating circumstances.
(c) Review of placement


(1) In general
An institutional review panel of a military correctional facility shall review the placement of an inmate in restrictive housing not later than 15 days after such placement and not less than every 15 days thereafter until such time as the inmate is removed from restrictive housing. 
(2) Removal plan
The head of each military correctional facility shall make a plan for the return of the inmate to less restrictive conditions and shall share such plan with the inmate, unless sharing such plan would put the health and safety of the inmate, staff, other inmates, or the public at risk.
(d) Employee training


(1) In general
The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the staff of each military correctional facility is trained on use of force and restrictive housing policies not less than quarterly. 
(2) Housing policy training
The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the staff of each military correctional facility complies with restrictive housing policies and that such policies are reflected in employee evaluation systems.

(3) Standing committees

(A) In general
The Secretary of Defense shall establish in each military correctional facility a standing committee, consisting of high-level correctional officials, active or retired, to regularly evaluate existing restrictive housing policies. (B) Duties
Each standing committee shall—
(i) review use of force and abuse allegations to include body camera or other digital recording footage and closed-circuit video footage of any use of force or abuse allegation; (ii) submit redacted written recommendations on preventing unlawful use of force or abuse to—
(I) the Secretary of Defense; and (II) the Committees on Armed Services of the House of Representatives and the Senate; and
(iii) assist military correctional facilities in developing safe and effective alternatives to restrictive housing and share with other military correctional facilities best practices for use of force to ensure safety for staff and confined individuals. (e) Gradual return to general population
 
(1) In general
Absent a compelling reason as determined by the Secretary of Defense, the head of a military correctional facility may not release inmates directly from restrictive housing to the general inmate population.

(2) Graduated system
The head of a military correctional facility shall consult with mental health professionals to ensure that shock of removal from isolation will not cause harm to the confined individual or the general inmate population. (f) Enrichment opportunities
 
(1) Establishment of policies
Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, each Secretary of Defense shall establish policies to:
(A) Increase the minimum amount of time inmates in restrictive housing spend outside their cells to 3 hours per day, including weekends and holidays, and to offer enhanced in-cell opportunities. (B) Afford to individuals in restrictive housing educational opportunities, using the minimum amount of protective restraint necessary to ensure safety of staff, population, and educational professionals.
(C) Make available to the inmates opportunities for recreation, education, clinically appropriate treatment therapies, skill-building, and social interaction with staff and other inmates. (D) Ensure that lower-risk individuals may conduct recreation time in such group size as the facility determines appropriate.
(E) Increase the ability of military correctional facilities to divert inmates with serious mental illness to mental health treatment programs or facilities when needed to serve the interest of the facility and the inmate. (F) Prohibit the placement of inmates in restrictive housing during the final 180 days of the term of imprisonment of such inmate.
(G) Provide targeted re-entry programming for inmates who require restrictive housing during the such final 180-day period. 
(2) Posting policies
