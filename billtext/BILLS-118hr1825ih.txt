Congress finds as follows:

(1) The Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–176) was enacted in 2018.

(3) Multiple schedule I drugs have progressed through phase I clinical trials and have been designated by the Food and Drug Administration as breakthrough therapies under section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 356) because of preliminary clinical evidence indicating that such drugs demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies, but eligible patients have not been permitted access to these drugs pursuant to the Federal Right to Try law. 3.
