1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the OFAC Outreach and Engagement Capabilities Enhancement Act. 2. Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) The Office of Foreign Assets Control is the United States Government agency responsible for administering and enforcing economic sanctions programs, primarily against countries and groups of individuals, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers.
(2) All United States persons must comply with OFAC regulations, including all United States citizens and permanent resident aliens regardless of where they are located, all persons and entities within the United States, all United States incorporated entities and their foreign branches. In the cases of certain programs, foreign subsidiaries owned or controlled by United States companies also must comply. Certain programs also require foreign persons in possession of United States-origin goods to comply.
(3) While the sanctions announcements are themselves notice of the requirements placed on all United States persons, OFAC conducts additional outreach through its compliance office, serving as OFAC’s primary liaison to the private sector and operating OFAC’s public hotline for sanctions-related questions and the conduct of civil investigations for potential sanctions violations.
(4) While many industries, such as large multinational financial institutions and industrial firms, have sophisticated sanctions departments to manage compliance with the strict-liability mandates from OFAC and to enact practices to defend their business’ sales and supply chains from abuse by sanctions-designated bad actors, many smaller entities and industries, do not.
(5) According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s 2021 Sanctions Review, Sanctions are only as effective as their implementation, especially with regard to communication and engagement. In order to better calibrate the use of this tool, Treasury needs to communicate and coordinate more effectively with stakeholders affected by the use of financial sanctions. Treasury can build on existing outreach and engagement capabilities through enhanced communication with industry, financial institutions, allies, civil society, and the media, as well as new constituencies, particularly in the digital assets space..
(6) The Assistant Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence noted in a 2022 speech to a private-sector audience at the American Conference Institute, We need to redouble efforts—to make sure that these networks do not pass under your radar and around our laws, and that when you obtain information about them, you promptly take action. This is not just a matter of compliance; it is a moral imperative. The choice is between permitting and preventing sanctions evasion—there is no space for neutral ground here..
(7) Examples of successful, robust Federal Government public-private sector outreach programs that support the agency mission abound from the law enforcement, Intelligence Community, and regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s InfraGard, the Public-Private Analytic Exchange Program from the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Financial Crime Enforcement Network’s FinCEN Exchange.
(8) The FinCEN Exchange, from OFAC’s sister agency within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, was mandated on January 1, 2021, when Congress enacted the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act). Section 6103 of the AML Act establishes the FinCEN Exchange to facilitate a voluntary public-private information-sharing partnership between law enforcement agencies, national security agencies, financial institutions, and FinCEN to effectively and efficiently combat money laundering, terrorism financing, organized crime, and other financial crimes, protect the financial system from illicit use, and promote national security.
(9) The objective of FinCEN Exchange is to develop, deliver, and sustain innovative public-private information sharing in order to enable the private sector to better identify risks and provide FinCEN and law enforcement with critical information to disrupt money laundering, terrorism financing, and other financial crimes. The program goals of the exchange are to:(A) Enhance communication, collaboration, and partnerships among FinCEN, law enforcement, and financial institutions.(B) Support priority national security and counter-illicit finance investigations and policies.(C) Enhance the utility of suspicious activity reports and share feedback with the private sector.(D) Encourage, enable, and acknowledge a focus on high-value and high-impact activities.(E) Conduct proactive outreach to allow industry to better prioritize efforts and utilize existing resources.3.
