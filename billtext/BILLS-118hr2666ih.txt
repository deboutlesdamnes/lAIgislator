1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Medicaid VBPs for Patients Act or the MVP Act.2. Findings
The Congress finds the following:
(1) Value-based payment (VBP) arrangements are a critical component of a modernized reimbursement system. By codifying elements of the recently finalized “multiple best price” policies of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Congress is enshrining a sustainable and flexible payment approach for innovative treatments and cures.
(2) Many of these treatments, including gene therapies, are different from traditional pharmaceutical and biologic products in that they can offer long-lasting—sometimes lifelong—benefits for patients and long-term value for the health care system alike.
(3) There are hundreds of innovative, curative, and life-changing treatments currently in development in the United States. However, the current reimbursement structure was not designed with these therapies in mind, and allowing for innovative payment arrangements will spur greater development and access to future cures and treatments.
(4) Medicaid is currently losing out on innovative ways to ensure patients have access to these treatments, while private payors continue to see the value provided through flexible payment arrangements.
(5) VBP arrangements include the ability to pay based on evidence-based outcomes and, over time, spreading the risk across all entities involved in the contract and ensuring that these often costly treatments are accessible.
(6) Evidence-based outcomes can demonstrate decreased cost to the health system and to patients, including reduced hospitalizations and lower utilization of other health care expenditures, including lab work, other medications, and office visits.
(7) By allowing VBPs in Medicaid, the health care system will continue to move towards quality over quantity, holding manufacturers and providers accountable for the best treatment for every patient.3. Codifying value-based purchasing arrangements under Medicaid and reforms related to price reporting under such arrangements
(a) Codifying the VBP rule
The revision to section 447.505(a) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, related to the inclusion of varying best price points available under a value-based purchasing arrangement (as defined in section 1927(k)(12) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r–8(k)(12), as added by subsection (d) of this section) for a single dosage form and strength of a covered outpatient drug if a manufacturer offers such pricing structure to all States, shall have the force and effect of law.(b) Quarterly reporting obligation

(1) In general
Section 1927(b)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r–8(b)(3)(A)) is amended—(A) in clause (iv), by striking at the end and;(B) in clause (v), by striking at the end the period and inserting ; and; (C) by inserting after clause (v) the following new clause:(vi) in conjunction with reporting required under clause (i), in the case of a covered outpatient drug that is sold under a value-based purchasing arrangement (as defined in subsection (k)(12)) made available by the manufacturer to a State plan—(I) the pricing structure for such drug based on pre-defined outcomes or measures specified in such value-based purchasing arrangement; and(II) the best price for such covered outpatient drug outside of a value-based purchasing arrangement, which in the event such drug is sold exclusively through such an arrangement, means the lowest price available net of any discounts or offsets that are unrelated to a refund, rebate, reimbursement, free item, withholding, or repayment made under a value-based purchasing arrangement for such drug.; and(D) by adding at the end of the flush left matter at the end the following new sentence: Information reported with respect to a rebate period under clause (i)(I) relating to average manufacturer price and clause (i)(II) relating to best price shall be updated for such rebate period if, subsequent to the date such information was reported, cumulative discounts, rebates, or other arrangements adjust such average price actually realized or best price available to the extent that such cumulative discounts, rebates, or other arrangements are not excluded under this section from the determination of average manufacturer price or best price.

(2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:(D) Special rule for certain value-based purchasing arrangements
For purposes of subparagraph (A), in determining the average price paid to the manufacturer for a covered outpatient drug that is sold under a value-based purchasing arrangement (as defined in paragraph (12)) that provides that payment for such drug is made in installments over the course of such agreement, such price shall be determined as if the aggregate price per the terms of the agreement was paid in full in the first installment during the rebate period..(d) Definition of value-Based purchasing arrangement
