In exercising the authority under this subsection with respect to any insured depository institution, the Corporation may guarantee deposits in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts for a single period not to exceed 60 days without regard for the requirements of subparagraph (B) if, upon the written recommendation of the Board of Directors (upon a vote of not less than two-thirds of the members of the Board of Directors) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (upon a vote of not less than two-thirds of the members of such Board), the Secretary of the Treasury (in consultation with the President) determines that—
(i) the Corporation’s compliance with subparagraphs (A) and (E) with respect to any insured depository institution for which the Corporation proposes to guarantee deposits in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts would have serious adverse effects on the stability of the entire banking system; and (ii) the Corporation’s proposed guarantee of deposits in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts would avoid or mitigate such adverse effects..
