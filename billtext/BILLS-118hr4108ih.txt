1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Protecting Americans' Data From Foreign Surveillance Act of 2023.2. Sense of Congress
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) accelerating technological trends have made sensitive personal data an especially valuable input to activities that foreign adversaries of the United States undertake to threaten both the national security of the United States and the privacy that the people of the United States cherish;
(2) it is therefore essential to the safety of the United States and the people of the United States to ensure that the United States Government makes every effort to prevent sensitive personal data from falling into the hands of malign foreign actors; and
(3) because allies of the United States face similar challenges, in implementing this Act, the United States Government should explore the establishment of a shared zone of mutual trust with respect to sensitive personal data.3. Requirement to control the export of certain personal data of United States nationals and individuals in the United States
(a) In general
Part I of the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C. 4811 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 1758 the following:1758A. Requirement to control the export of certain personal data of United States nationals and individuals in the United States
(a) Identification of categories of personal data

(1) In general
The Secretary shall, in coordination with the heads of the appropriate Federal agencies, identify categories of personal data of covered individuals that could—(A) be exploited by foreign governments or foreign adversaries; and(B) if exported, reexported, or in-country transferred in a quantity that exceeds the threshold established under paragraph (3), harm the national security of the United States.
(2) List required
In identifying categories of personal data of covered individuals under paragraph (1), the Secretary, in coordination with the heads of the appropriate Federal agencies, shall—(A) identify an initial list of such categories not later than one year after the date of the enactment of the Protecting Americans' Data From Foreign Surveillance Act of 2023; and(B) as appropriate thereafter and not less frequently than every 5 years, add categories to, remove categories from, or modify categories on, that list.
(3) Establishment of threshold
(A) Establishment
Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of the Protecting Americans' Data From Foreign Surveillance Act of 2023, the Secretary, in coordination with the heads of the appropriate Federal agencies, shall establish a threshold for determining when the export, reexport, or in-country transfer (in the aggregate) of the personal data of covered individuals by one person to or in a restricted country could harm the national security of the United States. (B) Number of covered individuals affected
(i) In general
Except as provided by clause (ii), the Secretary shall establish the threshold under subparagraph (A) so that the threshold is—(I) not lower than the export, reexport, or in-country transfer (in the aggregate) by one person to or in a restricted country during a calendar year of the personal data of 10,000 covered individuals; and (II) not higher than the export, reexport, or in-country transfer (in the aggregate) by one person to or in a restricted country during a calendar year of the personal data of 1,000,000 covered individuals. (ii) Exports by certain foreign persons
In the case of a person that possesses the data of more than 1,000,000 covered individuals, the threshold established under subparagraph (A) shall be one export, reexport, or in-country transfer of personal data to or in a restricted country by that person during a calendar year if the export, reexport, or in-country transfer is to—(I) the government of a restricted country;(II) a foreign person that owns or controls the person conducting the export, reexport, or in-country transfer and that person knows, or should know, that the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of the personal data was requested by the foreign person to comply with a request from the government of a restricted country; or(III) an entity on the Entity List maintained by the Bureau of Industry and Security of the Department of Commerce and set forth in Supplement No. 4 to part 744 of the Export Administration Regulations.(C) Category thresholds
The Secretary, in coordination with the heads of the appropriate Federal agencies, may establish a threshold under subparagraph (A) for each category (or combination of categories) of personal data identified under paragraph (1). (D) Updates
The Secretary, in coordination with the heads of the appropriate Federal agencies—(i) may update a threshold established under subparagraph (A) as appropriate; and (ii) shall reevaluate the threshold not less frequently than every 5 years.(E) Treatment of persons under common ownership as one person
For purposes of determining whether a threshold established under subparagraph (A) has been met—(i) all exports, reexports, or in-country transfers involving personal data conducted by persons under the ownership or control of the same person shall be aggregated to that person; and(ii) that person shall be liable for any export, reexport, or in-country transfer in violation of this section.(F) Considerations
In establishing a threshold under subparagraph (A), the Secretary, in coordination with the heads of the appropriate Federal agencies, shall seek to balance the need to protect personal data from exploitation by foreign governments and foreign adversaries against the likelihood of—(i) impacting legitimate business activities, research activities, and other activities that do not harm the national security of the United States; or(ii) chilling speech protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
(4) Determination of period for protection
The Secretary, in coordination with the heads of the appropriate Federal agencies, shall determine, for each category (or combination of categories) of personal data identified under paragraph (1), the period of time for which encryption technology described in subsection (b)(4)(A)(iii) is required to be able to protect that category (or combination of categories) of data from decryption to prevent the exploitation of the data by a foreign government or foreign adversary from harming the national security of the United States.
(5) Use of information; considerations
In carrying out this subsection (including with respect to the list required under paragraph (2)), the Secretary, in coordination with the heads of the appropriate Federal agencies, shall—(A) use multiple sources of information, including—(i) publicly available information;(ii) classified information, including relevant information provided by the Director of National Intelligence;(iii) information relating to reviews and investigations of transactions by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States under section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 4565); (iv) the categories of sensitive personal data described in paragraphs (1)(ii) and (2) of section 800.241(a) of title 31, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Protecting Americans' Data From Foreign Surveillance Act of 2023, and any categories of sensitive personal data added to such section after such date of enactment; (v) information provided by the advisory committee established pursuant to paragraph (7); and(vi) the recommendations (which the Secretary shall request) of—(I) experts in privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties, identified by the National Academy of Sciences; and(II) experts on the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States identified by the American Bar Association; and(B) take into account—(i) the significant quantity of personal data of covered individuals that is publicly available by law or has already been stolen or acquired by foreign governments or foreign adversaries;(ii) the harm to United States national security caused by the theft or acquisition of that personal data;(iii) the potential for further harm to United States national security if that personal data were combined with additional sources of personal data;(iv) the fact that non-sensitive personal data, when analyzed in the aggregate, can reveal sensitive personal data; (v) the commercial availability of inferred and derived data; and(vi) the potential for especially significant harm from data and inferences related to sensitive domains, such as health, work, education, criminal justice, and finance. 
(6) Notice and comment period

(8) Treatment of anonymized personal data
(A) In general
In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary may not treat anonymized personal data differently than identifiable personal data unless the Secretary is confident, based on the method of anonymization used and the period of time determined under paragraph (4) for protection of the category of personal data involved, it will not be possible for well-resourced adversaries, including foreign governments, to re-identify the individuals to which the anonymized personal data relates, such as by using other sources of data, including non-public data obtained through hacking and espionage, and reasonably anticipated advances in technology.(B) Guidance
The Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology shall issue guidance to the public with respect to methods for anonymizing data and how to determine if individuals to which the anonymized personal data relates can be, or are likely in the future to be, reasonably identified, such as by using other sources of data.
