1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Next Generation Fuels Act of 2023.2. Findings
Congress finds that—
(1) continued increases in new automobile efficiency are needed to improve consumer welfare and reduce carbon emissions;
(2) the widespread availability of low-carbon, high-octane fuel will allow continued cost-effective improvements in automobile efficiency by enabling increased engine compression ratios;
(3) high-octane automobiles and low-carbon fuels are readily available to consumers at little incremental cost;
(4) ethanol is a cost-effective and low-carbon octane enhancer;
(5) the widespread adoption of climate-smart practices and precision technologies by United States corn producers over the past decade have further reduced the carbon intensity of conventional ethanol;
(6) on average, ethanol has been estimated to have lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions that are 46 percent lower than average gasoline, with some corn ethanol achieving a 61-percent reduction compared to gasoline; and
(7) ethanol has one of the highest blending octane values available in the marketplace.3. High-octane vehicles
