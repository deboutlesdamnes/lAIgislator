(4) by adding at the end the following:  Such lists shall be updated not less frequently than annually. Beginning January 1, 2024, each hospital shall include in its lists of standard charges, along with such additional information as the Secretary may require with respect to such charges for purposes of promoting public awareness of hospital pricing in advance of receiving a hospital item or service, the following:

(C) The tool is prominently displayed on the hospital’s website and easily accessible to the public, without subscription, fee, or having to submit personal identifying information, and searchable by service description, billing code, and payer.The Secretary may not deem the establishment of an internet-based price estimator tool that meets the requirements of this paragraph to constitute compliance with the requirement of paragraph (1) that such hospital make available a list of standard charges for shoppable services for 2025 or a subsequent year.
