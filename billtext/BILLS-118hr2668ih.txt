1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the US Rescue and Aid Individuals of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2023.2. Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) Between 1933 and 1945, United States rescue and relief organizations were responsible for saving many thousands of Jews and other refugees during the Holocaust. American groups sponsored, financed, and organized numerous rescue and relief efforts in Nazi-occupied and neutral Europe.
(2) These organizations operated in every country in Europe. There were hundreds of American citizens involved in this effort.
(3) The Jewish refugees and others who were saved from almost certain death immigrated to the United States, Israel, and other parts of the world.
(4) Refugee agencies worked in the face of opposition to the resettling of Jewish refugees. In 1939, Congress rejected proposals to offer asylum to 20,000 Jewish children. In the same year, the United States refused asylum to Jewish refugees aboard the S.S. ST. LOUIS, who were forced to return to Europe, and 254 of whom died in the Holocaust.
(5) In addition, public opinion in America was largely against aiding refugees, especially through immigration.
(6) The rescue of Jews and other refugees was, in some cases, extremely dangerous, especially when conducted in Nazi-occupied territories or in collaborator nations. A number of rescuers were arrested, imprisoned, and some were killed.
(7) Many of these individuals and agencies aided in the relief and resettlement of Jewish refugees and others after the war.
(8) Among the most prominent was the War Refugee Board, which was responsible for saving the lives of 200,000 Jews and 20,000 non-Jews.
(9) A number of these organizations to be honored are still in existence and are continuing efforts to help refugees throughout the world.
(10) The individuals being honored include any individual who participated in the rescue or relief of Jews or other refugees who were in danger as a result of the Nazi genocidal policy against Jews and others in Europe, from 1933 to 1945.3. Congressional gold medal
