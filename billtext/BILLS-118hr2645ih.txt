1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Keeping Families Fed Act of 2023.2. Findings
The Congress finds the following:
(1) After February 2023 the emergency nutrition assistance benefits provided under the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 ended, resulting in a benefit cut for every SNAP recipient household in the 32 States then providing the emergency benefits.
(2) According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, every recipient household in those States now receives at least $95 reduction in SNAP benefits a month, and some households see reductions of $250 a month or more. The average household receives $90 a month less in emergency SNAP benefits.
(3) The ending of emergency allotments after February 2023 was required by an Act enacted in December 2022 that provided only 2 months for State agencies that administer SNAP and for SNAP recipients to prepare for a stark reduction in benefits. More resources and guidance for the end of the emergency SNAP benefits would have allowed the State agencies and SNAP recipients to better prepare for a benefit reduction and better prevent the hunger cliff caused by benefit reductions.3.
