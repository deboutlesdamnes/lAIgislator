(a) Safety Notice

(1) In general
If the Secretary determines that an in vitro clinical test presents an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health, and notification under this subsection is necessary to eliminate the unreasonable risk of such harm and no more practicable means is available under the provisions of this Act (other than this section) to eliminate the risk, the Secretary may issue such order as may be necessary to ensure that adequate safety notice is provided in an appropriate form, by the persons and means best suited under the circumstances, to all health care professionals who prescribe, order, or use the in vitro clinical test and to any other person (including developers, importers, distributors, retailers, and users) who should properly receive such notice.
(2) Notice to individuals
An order under this subsection shall require that the individuals subject to the risk with respect to which the order is to be issued be included in the persons to be notified of the risk unless the Secretary determines that notice to such individuals would present a greater danger to the health of such individuals than no such notice. If the Secretary makes such a determination with respect to such individuals, the order shall require the health care professionals who prescribed, ordered, or used the in vitro clinical test provide notification to the individuals for whom the health professionals prescribed, ordered, or used such test, of the risk presented by such in vitro clinical test and of any action which may be taken by or on behalf of such individuals to eliminate or reduce such risk. Before issuing an order under this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with the persons required to give notice under the order.(b) Repair, Replacement, or Refund

(1) Determination after an informal hearing
(A) In general
If, after affording opportunity for an informal hearing, the Secretary determines that—(i) an in vitro clinical test presents an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health;(ii) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the in vitro clinical test was not properly developed or manufactured considering the state of the art as it existed at the time of its development;(iii) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the unreasonable risk was not caused by failure of a person other than a developer, importer, distributor, or retailer of the in vitro clinical test to exercise due care in the installation, maintenance, repair, or use of the in vitro clinical test; and(iv) the notice authorized by subsection (a) would not by itself be sufficient to eliminate the unreasonable risk and action described in paragraph (2) of this subsection is necessary to eliminate such risk,the Secretary may order the developer, importer, or any distributor of such in vitro clinical test, or any combination of such persons, to submit to him within a reasonable time a plan for taking one or more of the actions described in paragraph (2). An order issued under the preceding sentence which is directed to more than one person shall specify which person may decide which action shall be taken under such plan and the person specified shall be the person who the Secretary determines bears the principal, ultimate financial responsibility for action taken under the plan unless the Secretary cannot determine who bears such responsibility or the Secretary determines that the protection of the public health requires that such decision be made by a person (including a health professional or user of the in vitro clinical test) other than the person the Secretary determines bears such responsibility.(B) Secretary approval of plan
The Secretary shall approve a plan submitted pursuant to an order issued under subparagraph (A) unless the Secretary determines (after affording opportunity for an informal hearing) that the action or actions to be taken under the plan or the manner in which such action or actions are to be taken under the plan will not assure that the unreasonable risk with respect to which such order was issued will be eliminated. If the Secretary disapproves a plan, the Secretary shall order a revised plan to be submitted within a reasonable time. If the Secretary determines (after affording opportunity for an informal hearing) that the revised plan is unsatisfactory or if no revised plan or no initial plan has been submitted to the Secretary within the prescribed time, the Secretary shall—(i) prescribe a plan to be carried out by the person or persons to whom the order issued under subparagraph (A) was directed; or(ii) after affording an opportunity for an informal hearing, by order prescribe a plan to be carried out by a person who is a developer, importer, distributor, or retailer of the in vitro clinical test with respect to which the order was issued but to whom the order under subparagraph (A) was not directed.
(2) Actions on a plan
The actions that may be taken under a plan submitted under an order issued under paragraph (1)(A) are as follows:(A) To repair the in vitro clinical test so that it does not present the unreasonable risk of substantial harm with respect to which the order under paragraph (1)(A) was issued.(B) To replace the in vitro clinical test with a like or equivalent test which is in conformity with all applicable requirements of this Act.(C) To refund the purchase price of the in vitro clinical test (less a reasonable allowance for use if such in vitro clinical test has been in the possession of the user for one year or more at the time of notice ordered under subsection (a), or at the time the user receives actual notice of the unreasonable risk with respect to which the order was issued under paragraph (1)(A), whichever occurs first).
(3) No charge
No charge shall be made to any person (other than a developer, importer, distributor, or retailer) for using a remedy described in paragraph (2) and provided under an order issued under paragraph (1), and the person subject to the order shall reimburse each person (other than a developer, manufacturer, importer, distributor, or retailer) who is entitled to such a remedy for any reasonable and foreseeable expenses actually incurred by such person in using such remedy.(c) Reimbursement
An order issued under subsection (b)(1)(A) with respect to an in vitro clinical test may require any person who is a developer, importer, distributor, or retailer of the in vitro clinical test to reimburse any other person who is a developer, importer, distributor, or retailer of such in vitro clinical test for such other person’s expenses actually incurred in connection with carrying out the order if the Secretary determines such reimbursement is required for the protection of the public health. Any such requirement shall not affect any rights or obligations under any contract to which the person receiving reimbursement or the person making such reimbursement is a party.(d) Recall Authority

(1) In general
