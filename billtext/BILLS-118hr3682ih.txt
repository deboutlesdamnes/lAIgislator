1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Cady Housh and Gemesha Thomas Student Suicide Prevention Act of 2023.2. Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1)  According to the National Institutes of Health, suicide is the second leading cause of death for young people between the ages of 10 and 34. Between 2007 and 2018, the national suicide rate among persons ages 1 to 24 increased 57.4 percent. From 2018 to 2021, the national suicide rate among persons ages 10 to 24 increased by 2.8 percent.
(2) According to the 2021 Youth Risk Behaviors Survey of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 22.2 percent of high school students reported seriously considering suicide during the previous 12 months, and 10.2 percent reported actually attempting to take their lives during that period.
(3) Eighty percent of students show warning signs before attempting suicide.
(4) Prevention and awareness training will equip individuals to become aware of the warning signs of suicide, identify students in crisis, and provide resources for help.
(5) Research shows that inquiring about suicide ideation, or discussing suicide in terms of recognizing risk factors and prevention methods—(A) does not increase the chance of suicide; and(B) in fact, can lower the risk of suicide.
(6) Sexual minority youth (LGBT+) are almost five times more likely to have attempted suicide compared to their heterosexual peers. According to the Trevor Project’s 2022 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health, 45 percent of LGBT+ youth seriously considered suicide in the past year including more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth and 1 in 3 cisgender youth. Additionally, 14 percent of LGBT+ youth attempted suicide in that same period, including nearly 1 in 5 transgender and nonbinary youth and 1 in 10 cisgender youth.
(7) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, emergency department visits among adolescents increased during the pandemic. During the period of February 21 to March 20 in 2021, suspected suicide attempt emergency department visits were 50.6 percent higher among girls aged 12 to 17 years than during the same period in 2019.3. Sense of Congress
It is the sense of the Congress that—
(1) student suicide awareness, prevention training, and response materials should be available to all school personnel, including administrative personnel, teachers, counselors, and other school leaders;
(2) States should give autonomy to each local educational agency to—(A) adopt a policy with respect to student suicide awareness and prevention; and(B) work collaboratively with local organizations, youth mental health experts, health care providers, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to implement training for school personnel and students, including by sharing and disseminating—(i) training materials and resources; and(ii) information that is evidence-informed or promising on student suicide prevention;
(3) the Secretary of Health and Human Services should identify the highest unmet needs, specifically with at-risk student populations, such as—(A) minority students;(B) LGBT+ identifying students;(C) students living with mental health conditions;(D) students living with substance use disorders;(E) students who have engaged in self-harm or have attempted suicide; and(F) students experiencing homelessness or out-of-home settings;
(4) schools should offer these services to students in grades 9 through 12, with the support of organizations with demonstrated expertise in cultural competency, suicide awareness, response, and prevention training;
(5) students who receive such training should not be taught to be counselors, but rather should be educated on how to—(A) recognize signs of suicide and depression;(B) report these signs to appropriate staff; and(C) identify sources of care and support; and
(6) schools should utilize school-based mental health professionals and other community partnerships.4. Student suicide awareness and prevention training
