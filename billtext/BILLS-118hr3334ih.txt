1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Sanctioning Tyrannical and Oppressive People within the Chinese Communist Party Act or the STOP CCP Act.2. Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) The Hong Kong National Security Law promulgated on July 1, 2020—(A) contravenes the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region that provides in Article 23 that the Legislative Council of Hong Kong shall enact legislation related to national security;(B) violates the People’s Republic of China’s commitments under international law, as defined by the Joint Declaration; and(C) causes severe and irreparable damage to the one country, two systems principle and further erodes global confidence in the People’s Republic of China’s commitment to international law.
(2) Repression of ethnic Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People’s Republic of China has been ongoing, and was formalized with the Strike Hard Campaign against Violent Terrorism that began in 2014.
(3) The mass internment of Uyghur and other Muslim ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has been ongoing since April 2017.
(4) The People’s Republic of China has conducted a targeted and systemic population-control campaign against ethnic and religious minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region by imposing and implementing coercive population-control practices, including selectively enforcing birth quotas, targeting minority women who are in noncompliance with birth quotas, and subjecting women to coercive measures such as forced birth control, forced sterilization, and forced abortion.
(5) On October 6, 2020, 39 countries delivered a cross-regional joint statement to the United States Mission to the United Nations on the human rights abuses on Uyghurs and other minorities for forced birth control including sterilization.
(6) On January 19, 2021, the Department of State determined that the People’s Republic of China committed crimes against humanity and genocide against Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, citing forced sterilizations, forced abortions, coerced marriages, and separation of Uyghur children from their families.
(7) The Department of State’s 2020 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices affirmed the genocide determination and noted coercive population control measures inflicted on ethnic and religious minority women in China, including forced injections with drugs that cause temporary or permanent end to their menstrual cycles and fertility.
(8) The United States ratified the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide in 1988, recognizing that imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group with intent to destroy a group in whole or part is an act that constitutes genocide.
(9) Taiwan is a free and prosperous democracy of nearly 24,000,000 people and an important contributor to peace and stability around the world.
(10) Section 2(b) of the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301(b)) states that it is the policy of the United States—(A) to preserve and promote extensive, close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and other relations between the people of the United States and the people on Taiwan, as well as the people on the China mainland and all other peoples of the Western Pacific area;(B) to declare that peace and stability in the area are in the political, security, and economic interests of the United States, and are matters of international concern;(C) to make clear that the United States decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China rests upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means;(D) to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States;(E) to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character; and(F) to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan.
(11) Since the election of President Tsai Ing-wen as President of Taiwan in 2016, the Government of the People’s Republic of China has intensified its efforts to pressure Taiwan through diplomatic isolation and military provocations.
(12) The rapid modernization of the People’s Liberation Army and recent military maneuvers in and around the Taiwan Strait illustrate a clear threat to Taiwan’s security.3. Sense of Congress
It is the sense of Congress that the Chinese Communist Party, led by General Secretary Xi Jinping, has committed numerous human rights violations against the people of Hong Kong and the people of Taiwan, as well as genocide against Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.4.
