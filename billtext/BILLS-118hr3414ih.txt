(4) Institutional Determined Limits

(A) In General
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an institution of higher education (at the discretion of a financial aid administrator at the institution) may prorate or limit the amount of a loan any student enrolled in a program of study at that institution may borrow under this part for an academic year or in the aggregate— (i) if the institution can reasonably demonstrate that student debt levels are or would be excessive for such program, based on—
(I) the most recently available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the average or median starting salary in the region in which the institution is located for typical occupations pursued by graduates of such program; or (II) the most recently available data from the College Scorecard (or successor website) on the median earnings of students who complete such program;  
(ii) in a case in which the student is enrolled on a less than full-time basis or the student is enrolled for less than the period of enrollment to which the annual loan limit applies under this part, based on the student’s enrollment status; (iii) based on the credential level (such as a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential) that the student would attain upon completion of such program; or
(iv) based on the year of the program for which the student is seeking such loan. (B) Increases for Individual Students
Upon the request of a student whose loan amount for an academic year has been prorated or limited under subparagraph (A), an eligible institution (at the discretion of the financial aid administrator at the institution) may increase such loan amount to an amount not exceeding the annual loan amount applicable to such student under this part for such academic year at the discretion of the financial aid administrator at the institution.
(C) Rule of construction
Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize a proration or limiting of loan amounts by an institution of higher education because of a student’s race, color, religion, sex, marital status, age, disability, or national origin. (D) Exception for certain students
This paragraph shall not apply to any student enrolled in a program of study at an eligible institution as of June 30, 2024, or any loans made under this part to such student for such enrollment, during the period required for the completion of such program..
