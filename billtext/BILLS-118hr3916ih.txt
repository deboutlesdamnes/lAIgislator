This Act may be cited as the Screening for Communities to Receive Early and Equitable Needed Services for Cancer Act of 2023 or the SCREENS for Cancer Act of 2023. 2. Findings
Congress finds the following:

(1) In 2023, there will be more than 300,590 new cases of invasive breast cancer and nearly 44,000 breast cancer deaths in the United States. 
(2) In 2023, there will be about 13,960 new cases of invasive cervical cancer and about 4,310 deaths from cervical cancer.

(3) Black women have the highest breast, cervical, and uterine cancer death rates of all racial and ethnic groups and are more likely to be diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, a more aggressive form of cancer. 
(4) Research shows that the COVID–19 pandemic was associated with a decline of more than 3,900,000 breast cancer screenings in 2020, as compared to 2019. Similarly, cervical cancer screening utilization dropped by 90 percent in April 2020, relative to the prior year.

(5) Research suggests that those postponed breast screenings appeared to disproportionately affect women of color: Non-Hispanic White women had 17 percent fewer breast cancer diagnoses, while the year-over-year decline was 53 percent for Asian women, 43 percent for Hispanic women, and 27 percent for Black women. 
(6) The National Cancer Institute estimates that pandemic-related disruptions or delays in breast care and screening are expected to result in an excess of 2,500 breast cancer deaths by 2030.

(7) Since its creation in 1991, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (referred to in this section as the NBCCEDP) has provided lifesaving cancer screening and diagnostic services to low-income, uninsured, or underinsured women in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, 6 territories, and 13 Tribes or Tribal organizations. 
(8) NBCCEDP seeks to reduce inequities in breast and cervical cancer screening and diagnosis, placing special emphasis on outreach to women who are members of racial or ethnic minority groups, and those who are geographically or culturally isolated.

(9) NBCCEDP has served more than 6,100,000 people and provided more than 15,700,000 breast and cervical cancer screening examinations. 
(10) These screening exams have diagnosed nearly 76,000 invasive breast cancers and more than 24,000 premalignant breast lesions, as well as more than 5,100 invasive cervical cancers and 235,000 premalignant cervical lesions, of which 39 percent were high-grade.

(11) The program also provides public education, outreach, patient navigation, and care coordination to increase breast and cervical cancer screening rates and reach underserved populations. 
(12) Reauthorizing NBCCEDP will result in expanded services, leading to more people being screened and more cancers diagnosed at earlier stages.
