Not later than the date on which the rules issued pursuant to subsection (a) take effect—(A) a licensee of a license granted under subsection (b)(1), a grantee of a grant of market access granted under subsection (c)(1), or an entity with a covered authorization, in a spectrum band with service rules that require such a licensee, grantee, or entity to share spectrum, shall make a good faith effort to coordinate the use of such shared spectrum (including the use of such shared spectrum by an individually licensed earth station) with any other such licensee, grantee, or entity with a covered authorization and any other entity that is authorized to use such shared spectrum; and(B) any other entity that is authorized to use such shared spectrum shall make a good faith effort to coordinate the use of such shared spectrum with any such licensee, grantee, or entity with a covered authorization.
(4) Protection from harmful interference
Not later than the date on which the rules issued pursuant to subsection (a) take effect, for any spectrum band in which the Commission grants a license under subsection (b)(1) or a grant of market access under subsection (c)(1) and for which the service rules require such a licensee or grantee to share spectrum (except with respect to the use of a gateway station), the Commission shall establish a quantifiable level of protection that (except with respect to the use of a gateway station) such a licensee or grantee shall afford to any other entity (including an entity with a covered authorization but not including a licensee of a license granted under subsection (b)(2) or a grantee of a grant of market access granted under subsection (c)(2)) that is authorized to use such shared spectrum.
(5) Consideration required
When establishing the quantifiable level of protection described in paragraph (4), the Commission shall, with respect to the entities to which the quantifiable level of protection is required under such paragraph to be afforded—(A) consider protection of such entities based on a degraded throughput methodology, requiring that, except in accordance with a coordination agreement, a licensee of a license granted under subsection (b)(1) or a grantee of a grant of market access granted under subsection (c)(1) may cause no more than a certain percentage increase in the link unavailability of such an entity and may reduce the throughput of such an entity by no more than a certain percentage;(B) consider protection of such entities from interference beyond a permissible interference-to-noise ratio, or whether interference-to-noise alone provides a sufficient level of protection; and(C) consider protection of such entities from harmful interference by awarding a greater share of spectrum during in-line events to earlier-filed systems.
(6) Relation to ITU radio regulations
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the Commission to adopt rules regarding the use of spectrum that contravene a requirement of the radio regulations of the International Telecommunication Union.
