(a) Findings
Congress finds that—
(1) many Federal agencies have important roles to play in addressing nonnative plant pests and pathogens in the stewardship and management of forests by those Federal agencies;
(2) because of a lack of national policy, nonnative plant pests and pathogens of forests are a low priority for all Federal agencies; and
(3) efforts to prevent the introduction and spread of nonnative plant pests and pathogens, and especially to reduce the resulting damage and restore tree species to forests, lack coordination and action.(b) Study

(1) In general
The Secretary of Agriculture (referred to in this section as the Secretary) shall seek to enter into an agreement (referred to in this section as the Agreement) with the National Academy of Sciences, or another nongovernmental entity that the Secretary determines to be most appropriate, under which the National Academy of Sciences or other entity, as applicable, not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, shall conduct, and submit to Congress a report describing the results of, a study to analyze the available resources that Federal agencies have to research, and find solutions to, nonnative plant pests and pathogens. 
(2) Recommendations
The report submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) shall include recommendations—(A) with respect to—(i) establishing a national policy to effectively counter the threat posed by nonnative pests and disease pathogens to tree species, including preventing the introduction and spread of those pests and pathogens, minimizing the damage caused by those pests and pathogens, and restoring affected tree species to the forest;(ii) improving coordination and cooperation among Federal agencies with responsibility for management and repair of the decimation of tree species affected by nonnative pests and disease pathogens and associated ecological destruction; (iii) addressing the low prioritization by the Federal agencies described in clause (ii) of nonnative plant pests and pathogens affecting forests and trees;(iv) (I) identifying expertise and site and facility resources within the Federal agencies described in clause (ii); and (II) improving coordination among those agencies with respect to the management and repair described in clause (ii), including coordination with academic institutions and other appropriate nonprofit organizations; (v) the establishment of a center for nonnative forest pest control, prevention, and species restoration within the Department of Agriculture, including potential organizational structures of such a center, with an emphasis on including representation of a wide variety of appropriate agencies within the center, including the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the Agriculture Research Service, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Forest Service, and any other agency that the Secretary determines is appropriate; and(vi) (I) giving priority to the emergency response of the Department of Agriculture to an emergency relating to nonnative pests and disease pathogens;(II) clarifying the coordination of the Department of Agriculture with other Federal agencies in responding to those emergencies; and (III) identifying funding levels sufficient to carry out responses to those emergencies; and (B) that—(i) take into account existing Federal resources; and(ii) may be implemented through further legislative and administrative action.
(3) Consultation
The Agreement shall require the National Academy of Sciences or other entity, as applicable, to consult with specialists in entomology, genetics, forest pathology, tree breeding, forest and urban ecology, and invasive species management.
