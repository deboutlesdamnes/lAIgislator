101. Purpose
 It is the purpose of this title to require coverage of home and community-based services (in this section referred to as HCBS) under a State plan (or waiver of such plan) under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) for the following reasons: 
(1) To eliminate waiting lists for HCBS, which delay access to necessary services and civil rights for people with disabilities and older adults.

(2) To build on decades of progress in serving people with disabilities and older adults via HCBS. 
(3) To fulfill the purposes of the Medicaid program to provide medical assistance for those whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services, and to provide rehabilitation, long-term services and supports, and other services to help such families and individuals attain or retain capability for independence or self-care.

(4) To ensure that people with all kinds of disabilities and with multiple disabilities, including intellectual disability, cognitive disabilities, developmental disabilities, behavioral health disabilities, physical disabilities, and substance use disorders, and older adults, receive the services they need to live in their communities. 
(5) To streamline access to HCBS by eliminating the need for States to repeatedly apply for waivers.

(6) To continue to increase the capacity of community services to ensure people with disabilities and older adults have safe and meaningful options in the community and are not at risk of unnecessary institutionalization. 
(7) To act on the decades of research and practice that show everyone, including people with the most severe disabilities, can live in the community with the right services and supports.

(8) To support over 53,000,000 unpaid family caregivers who are often providing complex services and supports to older adults and people with disabilities because of a lack of affordable services, workforce shortages, and other inefficiencies. 
(9) To improve direct care quality and address the decades long workforce barriers, which have been exacerbated by the COVID–19 pandemic, for nearly 2,600,000 direct care professionals providing support to people with disabilities and older adults in their homes and communities.

(10) To eliminate the race, gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity disparities that exist in accessing information and HCBS and to prevent the unnecessary impoverishment and institutionalization of black and brown individuals with disabilities and older adults.  102.

II Recognizing the role of direct support professionals

201. Findings
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Direct support professionals play a critical role in the care provided to children and adults individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

(2) Providers of home and community-based services are experiencing difficulty hiring and retaining direct support professionals, with a national turnover rate of 45 percent as identified in a 2016 study by the National Core Indicators. 
(3) High turnover rates can lead to instability for individuals receiving services, and this may result in individuals not receiving enough personalized care to help them reach their goals for independent living.

(4) A discrete occupational category for direct support professionals will help States and the Federal Government— (A) better interpret the shortage in the labor market of direct support professionals; and
(B) collect data on the high turnover rate of direct support professionals. 
(5) The Standard Occupational Classification system is designed and maintained solely for statistical purposes, and is used by Federal statistical agencies to classify workers and jobs into occupational categories for the purpose of collecting, calculating, analyzing, or disseminating data.

(6) Occupations in the Standard Occupational Classification system are classified based on work performed and, in some cases, on the skills, education, or training needed to perform the work. 
(7) Establishing a discrete occupational category for direct support professionals will—
(A) correct an inaccurate representation in the Standard Occupational Classification system; (B) recognize these professionals for the critical and often times overlooked work that they perform for the disabled community, which work is different than the work of a home health aide or a personal care aide; and
(C) better align the Standard Occupational Classification system with related classification systems. 202. Definition of direct support professional
