In this section:
(1) Gain-of-function research
The term gain-of-function research means any research that may be reasonably anticipated to confer an attribute to a pathogen such that the pathogen would have enhanced pathogenicity or transmissibility in mammals, including the creation of a chimera.
(2) Potential pandemic pathogen
The term potential pandemic pathogen means a pathogen that, as a result of any gain-of-function research—(A) is likely more transmissible or likely capable of wide and uncontrollable spread in human populations; (B) is likely more virulent or likely to cause modest or greater morbidity or mortality in humans; or(C) is likely to pose a severe threat to public health, the capacity of the public health systems to function, or national security.
