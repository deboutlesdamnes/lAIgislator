Any statement prepared under this subsection shall incorporate the inflationary impact of the debt servicing costs associated with the applicable major Executive order. To the greatest extent practicable, any estimate of the inflationary impact of any major Executive order under this section shall take into account the spending patterns of military personnel and of residents of non-metropolitan areas, including rural areas and farm households.

If an Executive order is determined to have a quantifiable inflationary impact on the consumer price index under subsection (a), the statement required by such subsection shall include the amount of such impact on the consumer price index in total and disaggregated by the Food, Energy, and All Items Less Food and Energy categories of the consumer price index (as such categories are determined by the Secretary of Labor in consultation with the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics).
