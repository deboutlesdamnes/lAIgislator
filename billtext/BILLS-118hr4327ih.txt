The term covered management measure means a dairy or livestock operation method that is used by an eligible producer to reduce baseline methane emissions and, where applicable, improve carbon sequestration on the operation of such eligible producer, including the measures described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) in subsection (f)(2).
(3) Eligible producer
The term eligible producer means a dairy or livestock producer—(A) who agrees to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by adopting at least 1 covered management measure as an alternative or complement to anaerobic systems that capture methane emissions;(B) whose baseline manure management practices prior to enrollment in the alternative manure management program include the anaerobic decomposition of volatile solids stored in a lagoon or other predominantly liquid anaerobic environment; or(C) in the case of a dairy or livestock producer whose baseline manure management practices prior to enrollment in the alternative manure management program includes an anaerobic system that captures methane emissions, that can replace or complement such anaerobic system with a covered management measure.
(4) Pasture-based management
The term pasture-based management means a dairy or livestock production system—(A) that eliminates or reduces the quantity of manure stored in anaerobic conditions; and(B) in which the livestock spend all or a substantial portion of time grazing on fields in which some or all of the manure is deposited and left in the field to decompose aerobically.
