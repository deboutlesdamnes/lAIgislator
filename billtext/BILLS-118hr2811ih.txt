IV Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny
331. Short title
This title may be cited as the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023.332. Purpose
The purpose of this title is to increase accountability for and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 of article I of the United States Constitution grants all legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the American people for the laws imposed upon them.333.
