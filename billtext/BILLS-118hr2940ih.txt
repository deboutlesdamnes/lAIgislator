(3) Definitions
In this subsection:(A) Applicable antimicrobial drug
The term applicable antimicrobial drug means an antimicrobial drug for which the sponsor of such drug receives a subscription contract under subsection (a).(B) Federal health care program
The term Federal health care program has the meaning given such term in section 1128B(f) of the Social Security Act, except that, for purposes of this subsection, such term includes the health insurance program under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code.(k) Failure To adhere to terms
