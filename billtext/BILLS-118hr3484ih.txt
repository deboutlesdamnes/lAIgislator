This Act may be cited as the Advanced Reactor Coordination Act or the ARC Act.  2. Advanced Reactor Coordination and Resource Center
 (a) In general
The President shall consider the feasibility of leveraging existing activities or frameworks or, as necessary, establishing a center, to be known as the Advanced Reactor Coordination and Resource Center (referred to in this section as the Center), for the purposes of—

(1) identifying qualified organizations and service providers— (A) for embarking civil nuclear nations;
(B) to develop and assemble documents, contracts, and related items required to establish a civil nuclear program; and (C) to develop a standardized model for the establishment of a civil nuclear program that can be used by the International Atomic Energy Agency;

(2) coordinating with countries participating in the Center— (A) to identify funds to support payment for services required to develop a civil nuclear program;
(B) to provide market analysis; and (C) to create—
(i) project structure models;  (ii) models for electricity market analysis; 
(iii) models for nonelectric applications market analysis; and  (iv) financial models;

(3) identifying and developing the safety, security, safeguards, and nuclear governance required for a civil nuclear program; 
(4) supporting multinational regulatory standards to be developed by countries with civil nuclear programs and experience;

(5) developing and strengthening communications, engagement, and consensus-building; 
(6) carrying out any other major activities to support export, financing, education, construction, training, and education requirements relating to the establishment of a civil nuclear program;

(7) developing mechanisms for how to fund and staff the Center; and 
(8) determining mechanisms for the selection of the location or locations of the Center.
(b) Objective
The President shall carry out subsection (a) with the objective of establishing the Center if the President determines that it is feasible to do so. (c) Definitions
In this section:

(1) Advanced nuclear reactor
The term advanced nuclear reactor means— (A) a nuclear fission reactor, including a prototype plant (as defined in sections 50.2 and 52.1 of title 10, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations)), with significant improvements compared to reactors operating on October 19, 2016, including improvements such as—
(i) additional inherent safety features; (ii) lower waste yields;
(iii) improved fuel and material performance; (iv) increased tolerance to loss of fuel cooling;

(vii) increased thermal efficiency; (viii) reduced consumption of cooling water and other environmental impacts;
(ix) the ability to integrate into electric applications and nonelectric applications; (x) modular sizes to allow for deployment that corresponds with the demand for electricity or process heat; and
(xi) operational flexibility to respond to changes in demand for electricity or process heat and to complement integration with intermittent renewable energy or energy storage; (B) a fusion reactor; and
(C) a radioisotope power system that utilizes heat from radioactive decay to generate energy.  
(2) Civil nuclear
The term civil nuclear means activities relating to—
(A) nuclear plant construction;  (B) nuclear fuel services; 
(C) nuclear energy financing; (D) nuclear plant operations;
(E) nuclear plant regulation; (F) nuclear medicine;

(I) infrastructure support for nuclear energy; (J) nuclear plant decommissioning;
(K) nuclear liability; (L) safe storage and safe disposal of spent nuclear fuel;
(M) environmental safeguards; (N) nuclear nonproliferation and security; and
(O) technology related to the matters described in subparagraphs (A) through (N).  
(3) Embarking civil nuclear nation
 (A) In general
The term embarking civil nuclear nation means a country that—
(i) does not have a civil nuclear energy program; (ii) is in the process of developing or expanding a civil nuclear energy program, including safeguards and a legal and regulatory framework, for—
