1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Senior Independence Act of 2023.2. Purpose and findings
(a) Purpose
The purpose of this Act is to increase the base exemption used by the Social Security Administration in determining the annual earnings limit for early retirees before monthly benefits are reduced. This legislation would increase the annual earnings limitation to $30,000 (or $2,500 per month for less than full year calculations) for the year 2024 and adjusted for wage inflation in the following years as required by current law.(b) Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) Allowing early retirees to earn more while retaining their Social Security benefits will have no impact on the solvency of the program because, under current law, any reductions in benefits for excess earnings are returned to the beneficiary after attaining full retirement age through increased monthly benefits.
(2) Increasing the earning limit for Social Security beneficiaries will result in the potential for increased collection of FICA taxes used to fund the program.3. Increase in monthly exempt amount for individuals not attaining retirement age
