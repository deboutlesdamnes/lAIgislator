1. Short title; findings
(a) Short title
This Act may be cited as the LEO Fair Retirement Act of 2023.(b) Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) Federal law enforcement officers are never off-duty. They are counted on to respond at any time of the day or night, regardless of their official duty status, to protect the public safety. Outside of our Nation’s Armed Forces, theirs is the only profession comprised of individuals who are routinely called upon to put their lives on the line to keep America safe.
(2) Though the Federal Government may house the largest variety of occupations of any U.S. employer across its panoply of agencies and entities, Federal law enforcement is absolutely unique among them, and the Federal law enforcement officer has no counterpart in the private sector. It is one of the most stressful, most dangerous, and most rewarding careers for those who meet the rigorous requirements of the job.
(3) It was in recognition of the unique nature of the occupation, and the demanding schedules required of those who fill its ranks, that Congress established distinct pay and benefit systems for Federal law enforcement positions. This includes basic pay, retirement, and even overtime compensation.
(4) Under current law, however, the payment of overtime compensation is limited, and is only payable to the extent that the payments do not cause the aggregate of the law enforcement officer’s biweekly or annual pay to exceed the pay caps established under section 5547 of title 5, United States Code. This often results in a law enforcement officer working significant amounts of overtime hours year after year for which the officer is never compensated.
(5) In light of the continuing homeland and national security threats facing our Nation, it is in the interest of the Federal Government to ensure that it can continue to recruit and retain the highest caliber personnel by allowing Federal law enforcement officers the opportunity to reclaim full credit in retirement for overtime hours worked but never paid.2.
