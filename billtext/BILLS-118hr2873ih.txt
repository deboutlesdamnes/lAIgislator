
1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Tribal Gaming Regulatory Compliance Act. 2. Findings
Congress finds as follows: 

(1) In 1987, the United States Supreme Court ruled in California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians that if California regulated rather than prohibited gaming in the State, then a Tribe could offer similar forms of gaming on its land. 
(2) In response to the Cabazon decision, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (Public Law 100–497) was enacted, which has since supported and promoted Tribal economic development and self-sufficiency, and continues to provide a regulatory structure for gaming on Tribal lands.

(3) Over 200 Tribes in 28 States are currently regulated under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. 
(4) On June 15, 2022, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama and Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Restoration Act (Public Law 100–89; 101 Stat. 666) allows the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe to offer gaming activities on Tribal lands that are not fully prohibited by Texas law and without regard to any Texas regulations over such gaming activities.

(5) The Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe are currently the only Tribes in the United States that are eligible to game on Tribal lands, but not regulated under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. 3. Amendment
The Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama and Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Restoration Act (Public Law 100–89; 101 Stat. 666 et seq.) is amended—

(1) by inserting after section 2, the following:  3. Rule of construction
This Act shall be construed to ensure the full applicability of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) to gaming activities on Indian lands of the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Indian lands of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe.;

(2) by striking section 107; and 
(3) by striking section 207.
