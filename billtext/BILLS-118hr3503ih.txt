This Act may be cited as the NIH Clinical Trial Diversity Act of 2023. 2. Diversity goals for clinical trials
 (a) Applications
Beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the National Institutes of Health (in this section referred to as the Secretary), shall require that a sponsor seeking to conduct a clinical trial investigating a drug, device (as those terms are defined in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321 et seq.)) biological product (as defined in section 351(i) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(i))), or behavioral intervention, the protocol for which is approved by the National Institutes of Health, to submit an application (or renewal thereof) for such approval that includes—

(1) clear and measurable goals for the recruitment and retention of participants that reflect— (A) the race, ethnicity, age, and sex of patients with the disease or condition being investigated; or
(B) the race, ethnicity, age, and sex of the general population of the United States if the prevalence of the disease or condition is not known; 
(2) a rationale for the goals specified under paragraph (1) that specifies—
(A) how investigators will calculate the number of participants for each population category that reflect the population groups specified in paragraph (1); or (B) strategies that will be used to enroll and retain participants across the different race, ethnicity, age, and sex categories;

(3) a detailed plan for how the clinical trial will achieve the goals specified under paragraph (1) that specifies— (A) the requirements for researchers, in conducting the trial, to analyze the population groups specified in paragraph (1) separately;
(B) the role of community partners or community institutional review boards in reviewing the plans; and (C) how the trial will recruit a study population that is— 
(i) in proportion to the prevalence of the disease or condition in such groups relative to the prevalence of the disease or condition in the overall population of the United States; (ii) in sufficient numbers to obtain clinically and statistically meaningful determinations of the safety and effectiveness of the drug, device, biological product, or behavioral intervention being studied in the respective race, ethnicity, age, and sex groups; and
(iii) consistent with the guidance under section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(b)(1)) and guidance issued by the National Institutes of Health on the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical trials; 
(4) the sponsor’s plan for implementing, or an explanation of why the sponsor cannot implement, alternative clinical trial follow-up requirements that are less burdensome for trial participants, such as—
(A) requiring fewer follow-up visits; (B) allowing phone follow-up or home visits by nurse trial coordinators (in lieu of in-person visits by patients);
(C) allowing for online follow-up options; (D) permitting the patient’s primary care provider to perform some of the follow-up visit requirements;
(E) allowing for evening and weekend hours for required follow-up visits;  (F) allowing virtual or telemedicine visits;
(G) use of wearable technology to record key health parameters; and (H) use of alternate labs or imaging centers, which may be closer to the residence of the patients participating in the trial; and

(5) the sponsor’s education and training requirements for researchers and other individuals conducting or supporting the clinical trial with respect to diversity and health inequities in, and the development of, curricula for healthcare professionals on how to participate in clinical trials as an investigator and how they can enroll patients in trials, which may include consultation with, and the review of materials made available by, such committees, task forces, working groups, and other entities the Director determines are appropriate, including the following: (A) The Equity Committee of the National Institutes of Health. 
(B) The National Advisory Council on Minority Health and Health Disparities. (C) The Advisory Committee on Research on Women's Health.
