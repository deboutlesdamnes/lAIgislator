1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Assuring that the Fact-Finding Examination Continues to Track Human Rights in Venezuela Act or the AFFECT Human Rights in Venezuela Act.2. Findings
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) The United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution adopted Resolution 42/25 on September 27, 2019, establishing an independent fact-finding mission (referred to in this Act as the Fact-Finding Mission) on the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to investigate extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment since 2014 with a view to ensuring full accountability for perpetrators and justice for victims.
(2) The mandate of the Fact-Finding Mission was extended by the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2020 for two years, and on October 7, 2022, for an additional two years, with a view to combating impunity and ensuring full accountability for perpetrators and justice for victims.
(3) The Fact-Finding Mission has faced several constraints, including lack of access to work in-country, travel limitations due to the COVID–19 pandemic, disrupted interviews due to electricity and internet failures, and limited ability to secure witness statements and key documents. Despite these challenges, the Fact-Finding Mission has been able to carry out its investigative and analytical work, and generate reports that serve as an invaluable resource for victims, civil society organizations, and international accountability mechanisms.
(4) The Fact-Finding Mission has identified specific incidents and patterns establishing reasonable grounds to conclude that violations of international human rights and criminal law have been committed in Venezuela, according to its October 2022 report.
(5) The Fact-Finding Mission’s October 2022 report concludes that crimes and violations, amounting to crimes against humanity, including extremely grave acts of torture, were committed by individuals holding various positions within the hierarchies of [the Venezuelan General Directorate of Military Counterintelligence] and [the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service] as part of a plan designed by high-level authorities to repress opponents of the Government.
(6) Marta Valinas, Chair of the Fact-Finding Mission, stated in January 2023 that the Maduro regime’s proposed law restricting the activities of nongovernmental organizations could represent a point of no return in the closure of the civic and democratic space and noted that organizations working in the areas of human rights in Venezuela are facing increased legal and operational hurdles, including surveillance by Venezuelan intelligence services and diminished access to funding.
(7) Women and girls fleeing Venezuela face grave threats of sexual violence, exploitation, and trafficking by armed groups operating in border regions, such as the Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional (ELN).
(8) The Fact-Finding Mission continues to urge members of the United Nations Human Rights Council to continue to pay close attention to developments in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and to monitor whether credible progress is being made in advancing justice, accountability and respect for human rights.
(9) The United States has historically used its voice, vote, and influence at the United Nations to address human rights abuses around the world and to seek to hold perpetrators accountable.3. Actions relating to the fact-finding mission on Venezuela
